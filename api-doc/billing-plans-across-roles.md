# Billing, Plans & Credit — Cross-Dashboard Guide

**Verified against backend source on 2026-08-24** — `scripts/seed/seed-pricing-plans.ts`,
`src/modules/billing/services/entitlement.service.ts`, and the live route dump.

> **This is a concept page.** The vendor endpoints it summarises are documented in full at
> [`vendor/billing.md`](./vendor/billing.md) (plans, purchase, verify, credit) and
> [`vendor/billing-overview.md`](./vendor/billing-overview.md). Read this one for the
> *shape of the model*; read those two to build a screen.
>
> Sections about agency, agent and admin are here because the engine is shared and the
> vocabulary is identical — **not** because a vendor dashboard can call them.

One billing engine now serves **four dashboards**: vendor, agency, agent, and
admin. Vendors already had plans + a credit wallet; **agencies and agents now have
the identical surface** under their own role roots, and admin manages the catalog
for all three. This page is the map — what is shared, what differs per role, and
which doc each dashboard team should build from.

## The shared model in one paragraph

Every role has **3 pricing-plan tiers** (a free one + two paid). A subscriber holds
at most **one active plan + one queued (`pending_activation`)** plan at a time.
Buying a paid plan charges a payment gateway directly (NotchPay / MyCoolPay /
Stripe) and, on confirmation, activates or queues the plan automatically — **no
recurring charge**; a paid term simply **expires** after `term_days` and either
hands over to the queued plan or **downgrades to the role's free tier** (a daily
server job). Activating a plan grants its `credit_allowance` once into the role's
**credit wallet**; the wallet can also be topped up with credit packs. There is no
"spend credits" endpoint — credits are metered by other actions.

> **Plan and credit purchases do NOT use the `/api/payments` surface.** Billing talks to the gateway
> through its own adapter and creates **no `PaymentTransaction`** row, so its purchases are polled
> with `POST /api/{role}/plan-purchases/:id/verify` and `POST /api/{role}/credits/topups/:id/verify`
> — never `GET /api/payments/:transactionId`. The 2026-07-29 change that made that endpoint
> authenticated and owner-scoped therefore has **no effect on vendor, agency or agent billing**. It
> concerns customer order/cart/booking payments only — see [payments/README.md](./payments/README.md).

## Per-dashboard summary

| | Vendor | Agency | Agent | Admin |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Base path** | `/api/vendor` | `/api/agency` | `/api/agent` | `/api/internal/admin/billing` ** |
| **Doc** | [vendor/billing.md](./vendor/billing.md) | `agency/billing.md` * | `agent/billing.md` * | `admin/docs/api/billing.md` (wi-admin) |
| **Free tier** | `starter` | `agency_free` | `agent_free` | — |
| **Plan limit** | products / storage / commission | `max_unterminated_shipments` (**soft**) | `max_unterminated_shipments` (**hard**) | defines all |
| **Free-tier limit** | 15 products, 1 GB, 7% | **1000** unterminated shipments | **20** concurrent deliveries | — |
| **Enforcement** | product create blocked at cap (`403 BILLING_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`) | never blocks — alert only | offer-accept blocked at cap (`422 AGENT_AT_CAPACITY`) | — |
| **Paid tiers today** | active | `is_active:false` (build UI, not yet buyable) | `is_active:false` | manage via catalog |

* not mirrored in this repository — the page lives in the backend's own `api-doc/`.
** **not browser-reachable.** See [§ Admin](#admin-catalog--assignment) below.

**Vendor figures verified in `scripts/seed/seed-pricing-plans.ts:47-51`:** `starter` —
15 active products, 1 GB, 7 % commission, 50 credits. All three vendor tiers are
`is_active: true`; the enforcement throw is `entitlement.service.ts:85`, a **403**
`BILLING_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` carrying `details: { limit, current }`.

> **Launch state:** for agency and agent, **only the free tier is active** right now
> (`GET /{role}/plans` returns one plan). The two paid tiers per role are seeded but
> inactive. Build the upgrade UI to render whatever active plans the catalog returns
> — don't hardcode tiers — and it lights up when the paid tiers are switched on.

## The catalog is also readable without a session

`GET /api/public/plans` and `GET /api/public/credit-packs` serve the same catalog to a **logged-out**
caller, for the marketing site — which prints real prices and previously had to hand-copy them out of
`seed-pricing-plans.ts` and `credit.config.ts`. Same numbers, a trimmed projection (`id` instead of
`_id`, no internal timestamps), plus `?role=` / `?includeInactive=true` and a 5-minute
`Cache-Control`. Contract: `public/README.md` in the backend repository's `api-doc/` — not mirrored here,
because a vendor dashboard always has a session and should call the authenticated route.

**Dashboards should keep using the authenticated `GET /api/{role}/plans`** — it is scoped to the
caller's role and needs no filtering. The public route exists for pages that have no session at all.

## Shared endpoints (same shape for vendor / agency / agent)

Swap `{role}` for `vendor`, `agency`, or `agent`:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/{role}/plans` | Active plan catalog |
| GET | `/api/{role}/plan` | Current active + pending plan, entitlements (+ shipment usage for agency) |
| POST | `/api/{role}/plans/:planId/purchase` | Start a self-serve plan purchase |
| POST | `/api/{role}/plan-purchases/:id/verify` | Verify & apply after payment (poll) |
| GET | `/api/{role}/credits` | Credit balance (can be **negative** after a chargeback) |
| GET | `/api/{role}/credits/packs` | Buyable credit packs |
| POST | `/api/{role}/credits/topups` | Start a top-up |
| POST | `/api/{role}/credits/topups/:id/verify` | Verify & credit the wallet (poll) |
| GET / PATCH | `/api/{role}/settings` | Plan-expiry notice window (`notifyDaysBeforeExpiry`, 0–90) |
| GET | `/api/{role}/transactions` | Unified plan + credit + earnings history |

**Payment / verify / polling** mechanics (gateway `instructions`, Stripe client-secret
flow, the two-plan activate-now-vs-queue rule, idempotent verify, ~3–5s polling) are
documented once in [vendor/billing.md](./vendor/billing.md) and apply unchanged to
every role. Stripe specifics: [vendor/stripe-payments.md](./vendor/stripe-payments.md).

### Response field names (changed)

The plan-assignment object is keyed **`subscriberPlan`** and carries
`owner_type` + `owner_id` (generalized from the old vendor-only `vendorPlan` /
`vendor_id`); the purchase record's applied-plan field is **`subscriber_plan_id`**
(was `vendor_plan_id`). Any existing vendor-dashboard code reading the old names
must be updated.

## Admin (catalog + assignment)

> ### 🔴 `/api/admin/*` no longer exists, and none of this is browser-reachable.
>
> This section previously listed `GET /api/admin/plans`, `POST /api/admin/plans` and
> `POST /api/admin/{vendors|agencies|agents}/:id/plan`. **jovi-mall's public `/api/admin`
> mount was removed** (Phase 5 close-out); the catalog surface moved to
> `/api/internal/admin/billing/*`, which is guarded by `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN` and is
> reachable only by **wi-admin**, server to server. There is no session, cookie or bearer
> token a browser can present to it.
>
> It is kept here, relabelled rather than deleted, for one reason: the field names on this
> surface are the field names you read. A plan created there with `max_active_products: 150`
> is the `maxActiveProducts: 150` your entitlement screen renders.

The eight routes, from the live route dump — **for orientation only**:

| Method | Path |
|---|---|
| GET · POST | `/api/internal/admin/billing/plans` |
| PATCH · DELETE | `/api/internal/admin/billing/plans/:id` |
| POST | `/api/internal/admin/billing/vendors/:vendorId/plan` |
| POST | `/api/internal/admin/billing/agencies/:agencyId/plan` |
| POST | `/api/internal/admin/billing/agents/:agentId/plan` |
| GET | `/api/internal/admin/billing/entitlements/:ownerType/:ownerId` |

Send only the limit fields the target role uses — `max_active_products` /
`max_storage_bytes` / `commission_percent` for vendor, `max_unterminated_shipments` for
agency and agent, `live_tracking_enabled` for both. A manual assignment takes no payment;
assigning an agent plan updates their delivery ceiling immediately.

## Notifications each dashboard must render

All three role notification stacks gained a **`planUpdates`** preference (defaults on)
and these situations — build them into the notification UI and preferences screen:

| Situation | Roles | Fires when | Deep-link |
|---|---|---|---|
| `plan.expiring` | vendor, agency, agent | Plan enters the notice window | `plans` |
| `plan.expired` | vendor, agency, agent | Plan expired → handover or downgrade to free | `plans` |
| `shipment.cap.exceeded` | agency only | Crossed the unterminated-shipment soft cap (once per crossing) | `plans` |

- Per-role notification docs: [vendor](./vendor/notifications.md) · `agency/notifications.md` and `agent/notifications.md` (backend repo only).
- Each notification is in-app (always) + push + one preference-gated channel, localized.
- **Deep-link route:** every plan/cap notification's `action.path` is `plans` — each SPA must implement a `plans` route (it's appended to `VENDOR_APP_URL` / `AGENCY_APP_URL` / `AGENT_APP_URL`).
- WhatsApp needs the `{vendor,agency,agent}_plan_*` and `agency_shipment_cap_exceeded` templates approved in Meta before that channel delivers (in-app/push/email/Telegram work regardless): [whatsapp-templates.md](./notifications/whatsapp-templates.md) §9.

## Cap behaviour — the one real per-role difference

- **Agency cap is SOFT.** `GET /agency/plan` returns `shipments: { maxUnterminatedShipments, currentUnterminated, remaining }` for a usage meter. When `remaining === 0`, show "at capacity — upgrade", but **never disable** a shipment/checkout action — deliveries keep flowing and a `shipment.cap.exceeded` alert is raised instead.
- **Agent cap is HARD and plan-driven.** The plan sets the agent's concurrent-delivery ceiling; accepting an offer past it returns `422 AGENT_AT_CAPACITY`. The current held-count comes from the agent working-state surface, not billing.

## Live tracking (build now, gate later)

Every plan carries `live_tracking_enabled` (currently `true` everywhere). Read it,
but **do not gate any tracking UI on it yet** — it exists so a future free-tier
tracking restriction is a data change, not a frontend release. When it flips, hide
live tracking where the entitlement is `false`.

## Where the backend's own doc is wrong

Filed as **F-30** in the sync register.

🔴 `jovi-mall/api-doc/billing-plans-across-roles.md:88-90` had been corrected to
`/api/internal/admin/billing/*`, but its **per-dashboard table still shows the admin base
path as `/api/admin`** and still links `admin/billing.md` — a page describing a mount that
no longer exists. Half-updated, the same failure mode as `telegram/README.md`.

🟡 The same table's **`Doc` row links four sibling pages**, three of which this repository
has never mirrored. That is not a backend defect; it is what makes a cross-role page
dangerous to copy verbatim into a single-role repo, and why this copy names them instead.

---

## Payment disputes (all roles)

Card charges can be reversed after the fact (webhook-driven, no user action):
a reversed **plan purchase** downgrades the owner to their free tier; a reversed
**top-up** claws credits back (balance can go negative). Render `status: "reversed"`
in history and handle negative balances.
