/**
 * Connectivity (CAPACITOR-PLAN.md → P3.4).
 *
 * One source of truth for "is this device on the network?", so the sidebar
 * status dot, the offline banner and the notification reconciler all agree
 * instead of each asking a different oracle.
 *
 * Native reads `@capacitor/network`, which reflects the OS's own connectivity
 * manager — airplane mode, a dropped cell, a Wi-Fi network that vanished. The
 * browser falls back to `navigator.onLine` plus its `online`/`offline` events,
 * which is exactly what the `PlatformStatus` placeholder always said it would
 * use.
 *
 * ⚠ **`navigator.onLine` answers a narrower question than it looks like it
 * does.** It reports whether the machine has *a* network interface up, not
 * whether the internet is reachable: a laptop on a captive-portal Wi-Fi is
 * "online" and can reach nothing. So it is honest about the case the exit
 * criteria name (airplane mode) and optimistic about a broken uplink. Treat
 * `connected === false` as proof of offline and `connected === true` as an
 * absence of proof — which is why nothing here signs anyone out, cancels a
 * request or blocks a form.
 *
 * Like every module under `src/platform/`, this one falls back to today's
 * browser behaviour when `isNative` is false (ground rule 3). ⚠ Unlike most of
 * them, its consumers are *deliberately* web-visible: the web build gains an
 * offline banner and an honest status dot where it used to show green in
 * airplane mode. That is the fix, not a side effect — see the plan's rollback
 * posture.
