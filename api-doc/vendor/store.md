# Store Profile Management API Documentation

**Verified against source on 2026-09-08** — R7 re-checked the three routes (`modules/store/routes.ts:25,44,53`), the twelve-field model (`models/store.model.ts:11-27`) and the `publicUrl` base and default (`config/store.config.ts:19` — `/shop/stores`, correct at all five occurrences on this page). No defects found.

**Verified against source on 2026-09-06** — every claim on this page was checked against
`jovi-mall/src/`, including the whole inherited defect list that `vendor-dash` carried for it
(DOC-PROGRAM § 24–26). Corrections are marked inline with ⚠ and a source citation.

## Overview

The Store Profile Management API allows vendors to manage their public storefront - the commercial surface of their business on the platform. Each vendor has exactly one store, **auto-created on first access** (and provisioned during onboarding Step 1). Vendors can view and update store details and manage vacation mode, but cannot modify the immutable `slug`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The store carries no address, city, or country of its own.**
> - Physical locations (which are also pickup locations) are the vendor profile's
>   **`business_addresses`** — geocoded, mappable, and validated against the
>   vendor's registered country. Manage them via
>   [`PATCH /api/vendor/profile`](./profile.md#patch-apivendorprofile).
> - **`country`** lives on the vendor profile (set once during onboarding,
>   immutable afterwards) and is served **read-only** in store responses.

**Base URL**: `/api/vendor`

**Authentication**: All endpoints require a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header with vendor role.

**Standard**: Shopify/Etsy/Amazon Storefront service quality.

## Endpoints

### GET /api/vendor/store

Retrieve the authenticated vendor's store profile.

#### Authentication

- **Required**: Yes
- **Role**: `vendor`

#### Headers

```http
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

#### Response

**Success (200 OK)**:

}
```

**Field Descriptions**:
- `slug`: URL-safe store identifier (READ-ONLY, immutable in vendor API)
- `country`: ISO country code (READ-ONLY) — **sourced from the vendor profile**, not stored on the store. `null` until onboarding Step 1 sets it.
- `isOpen`: Vacation mode status (true = open, false = on vacation)
- `publicUrl`: Computed from slug, not editable directly
- `version`: Optimistic locking counter

**Auto-provisioning**: if the vendor has no store row yet (accounts created before
store provisioning existed), this endpoint creates it on the fly — name derived
from the business name given at signup (else the vendor's display name), slug auto-generated and unique.

#### Error Responses

**Unauthorized (401)** — no credential presented (`auth.middleware.ts:126`):

```json

  "success": false,
  "requestId": "req_01J…",
  "error": {
    "code": "AUTH_MISSING_TOKEN",
    "message": "Authentication token required",

}
```

**Forbidden (403)** — signed in as the wrong role (`requireRole`, `auth.middleware.ts:365`):

```json
{
  "success": false,

    "details": { "required": ["vendor"], "actual": "customer" }
  }
}
```

**Not Found (404)**:

> [!WARNING]
> Should not occur in practice: the store is **auto-created on first access**
> (get-or-create) and provisioned during onboarding Step 1. A 404 here means the
> vendor profile itself is missing — a system bug.

### PATCH /api/vendor/store

Update the authenticated vendor's store profile.

#### Authentication

- **Required**: Yes
- **Role**: `vendor`

#### Headers

```http
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "name": "TechSolutions Premium",
  "logoFileId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439030",
  "bannerFileId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439031",
  "description": "Updated description with new offerings",
  "supportEmail": "hello@techsolutions.com",
  "supportPhone": "+237698765432",
  "supportWhatsapp": "+237698765432",
  "version": 5
}
```

**Fields** (all optional except `version`):

- `name` (string, 2-100 chars): Store display name — **not clearable** (required field)
- `logoFileId` (string, MongoDB ObjectId, *clearable*): Id of a logo file previously uploaded via `POST /api/files/upload`. The response returns the resolved `logo` file object (`{ id, key, url, access, mimeType, size, originalName }` | null). Registers a `file_references` row so the file is not garbage-collected while set.
- `bannerFileId` (string, MongoDB ObjectId, *clearable*): Id of a banner/hero file uploaded via `POST /api/files/upload`. The response returns the resolved `banner` file object (same shape as `logo`).
- `description` (string, max 1000 chars, *clearable*): Store description
- `supportEmail` (string, valid email, lowercased, *clearable*): Support contact email
- `supportPhone` (string, **E.164** e.g. `+237612345678`, *clearable*): Support contact phone
- `supportWhatsapp` (string, **E.164**, *clearable*): WhatsApp support number

> Phone and email formats are platform-wide — see [Contact formats](../README.md#contact-formats-phone--email).
- `version` (**required**, number): Current store version for optimistic locking

> **No `address` / `city` / `country` here.** Physical store locations are the
> vendor profile's `business_addresses` (with geocoded coordinates for maps);
> the country is set once during onboarding and served read-only. See
> [Vendor Profile](./profile.md#patch-apivendorprofile).

**Clearing a field**: every field marked *clearable* accepts three states:

| You send | Effect |
|---|---|
| key omitted | field left unchanged |
| `null` or `""` (or whitespace-only) | field **cleared** — stored and returned as `null` |
| a value | must satisfy the field's constraint (URL, email, length…) |

```json
{ "version": 5, "logoFileId": null }
```
and
```json
{ "version": 5, "logoFileId": "" }
```
are equivalent: both remove the logo. A non-empty invalid value (e.g. `"logoFileId": "not-an-id"`) is still rejected with `VALIDATION_ERROR`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Immutable Fields**: `slug` cannot be updated, and `country` is not stored on the store at all (it lives on the vendor profile, set-once).
>
> ⚠ **Sending either is SILENTLY STRIPPED — it is not rejected, and you get a `200`.** `UpdateStoreProfileSchema` is a plain `z.object` (not `.strict()`), so Zod removes both keys before the controller passes the parsed value on (`store.controller.ts:57`). The service's two guards read `rawInput.slug` / `rawInput.country` on that already-stripped object (`store-profile.service.ts:147-153`), so they are **dead code and neither 403 can be raised.** A client that sends a new slug is told the save succeeded and the slug is unchanged.

**~~Slug Immutability (403)~~ — UNREACHABLE**:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Slug is READ-ONLY in the vendor API. Only an admin can change slugs (a future feature, with URL redirects). ⚠ **The body below is never sent** — the key is stripped before the check that would produce it (see the note under "Immutable Fields" above). It is kept here, struck through in the heading, because a shipped client may still branch on `AUTH_FORBIDDEN` here; that branch is dead.

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "requestId": "3f8a1c74-9b2e-4d10-8c55-6a0f2b7e19dd",

  }
}
```

**~~Country Not Stored Here (403)~~ — UNREACHABLE**:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The store has no country field. The country lives on the vendor profile — set once during onboarding, immutable afterwards. ⚠ **The body below is never sent**, for the same reason as the slug case above: `country` is stripped by the schema before the guard reads it.

```json

> instead. Same defect class as `VENDOR_FISCAL_CALENDAR_INVALID` on the vendor profile
> ([`profile.md`](./profile.md)); renaming either is a breaking wire change and has not been made.

### PATCH /api/vendor/store/status

Toggle store vacation mode (open/close store temporarily).

#### Authentication

- **Required**: Yes
- **Role**: `vendor`

#### Headers

```http
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "isOpen": false,
  "version": 6
}
```

**Fields**:

- `isOpen` (**required**, boolean):
  - `true` = Open for business
  - `false` = On vacation (store temporarily closed)
- `version` (**required**, number): Current store version for optimistic locking

#### Response

**Optimistic Locking Conflict (409)**:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "requestId": "3f8a1c74-9b2e-4d10-8c55-6a0f2b7e19dd",
  "error": {

    "message": "Store was modified by another request. Please refresh and try again.",
    "statusCode": 409,
    "category": "conflict"
  }
}
```

#### Notes

**Vacation Mode Behavior**:
- When `isOpen: false`, the store is marked as "on vacation"
- Customers may see a notice on the storefront
- New orders may be disabled (implementation-dependent)
- Future implementation may add admin suspension (`is_suspended`), with effective state: `isOperational = isOpen && !isSuspended`

---

## Optimistic Locking

All store updates use **optimistic locking** to prevent data loss from concurrent modifications.

### How It Works

1. Client fetches store: `GET /api/vendor/store` → receives `version: 5`
2. Client modifies fields locally
3. Client sends update: `PATCH /api/vendor/store` with `version: 5`
4. Server checks if current version is still `5`
   - **Match**: Update succeeds, version incremented to `6`
   - **Mismatch**: Returns 409 Conflict error
5. On conflict, client refreshes store and retries

### Best Practices

- Always include the `version` field in update requests
- Handle 409 Conflict errors by refreshing data and prompting user to retry
- Display clear message: "Store was updated elsewhere. Please refresh and try again."

---

## Immutable Fields

### Slug

**Status**: READ-ONLY in vendor API

**Rationale**:
- Changing slugs breaks SEO rankings
- Breaks marketing campaigns, social shares, external links
- Creates support nightmares

**Future**: Admin-only slug changes with automatic URL redirects

**Error if attempted**:
```json
{
  "code": "AUTH_FORBIDDEN",
  "message": "Slug cannot be modified. Contact support if you need to change your store URL."
}
```

### Country

**Status**: NOT STORED ON THE STORE — read-only mirror of the vendor profile's country

**Rationale**:
- One canonical country per vendor (set once during onboarding Step 1, immutable after)
- Locked for tax compliance and shipping calculation
- Anchors the business-address policy: every geocoded business address must resolve inside it

**Error if attempted here**:
```json
{
  "code": "PROFILE_COUNTRY_IMMUTABLE",
  "message": "Country is not stored on the store. It lives on your vendor profile and is set once during onboarding."
}
```

---

## Public URL

The `publicUrl` field is **computed, not stored**:

```typescript
publicUrl = `${STORE_PUBLIC_URL_BASE}/${encodeURIComponent(slug)}`
```

**Configuration**:
```env
STORE_PUBLIC_URL_BASE=https://yourdomain.com/shop/stores
```

**Example**:
- Slug: `techsolutions`
- Public URL: `https://yourdomain.com/shop/stores/techsolutions`

**Future enhancements**:
- Custom domains (`https://store.techsolutions.com`)
- Custom subdomains (`https://techsolutions.yourdomain.com`)

## Domain Events & Audit Logging

### Events Emitted

**Store Profile Updated**:
```javascript
eventBus.publish('store.profile.updated', {
  eventType: 'store.profile.updated',
  aggregateId: storeId,
  payload: {
    vendorId,
    storeId,
    changes: {
      name: { from: 'Old Name', to: 'New Name' },
      description: { from: 'Old Desc', to: 'New Desc' }
    }
  },
  occurredAt: new Date()
});
```

**Store Status Changed**:
```javascript
eventBus.publish('store.status.changed', {
  eventType: 'store.status.changed',
  aggregateId: storeId,
  payload: {
    vendorId,
    storeId,
    isOpen: false,
    reason: 'vacation_mode'
  },
  occurredAt: new Date()
});
```

**Store Slug Changed** (Admin-only, future):
```javascript
eventBus.publish('store.slug.changed', {
  eventType: 'store.slug.changed',
  aggregateId: storeId,
  payload: {
    vendorId,
    oldSlug: 'old-store',
    newSlug: 'new-store',
    redirectUrl: 'https://yourdomain.com/shop/stores/new-store'
  },
  occurredAt: new Date()
});
```

### Audit Logs

All store updates and status changes are logged for compliance:

```javascript
auditLogger.log({
  actor: { userId: vendorId, role: 'vendor' },
  action: 'STORE_PROFILE_UPDATED',
  resource: { type: 'Store', id: storeId },
  changes: { name: { from: 'Old', to: 'New' } },
  timestamp: new Date()
});
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### Multiple Stores Per Vendor

The system is designed for future multi-store support:

- Remove `vendor_id` unique constraint
- Add store selection UI
- Filter by `vendorId` in queries
- Introduce `is_primary: boolean` flag

### Custom Domains

```typescript
{
  custom_domain: "store.vendor.com",
  dns_verified: true,
  ssl_enabled: true
}
```

### Store Themes

```typescript
{
  theme_id: "minimal-dark",
  primary_color: "#2a9d8f",
  secondary_color: "#e76f51"
}
```

### SEO Settings

```typescript
{
  meta_title: "Premium Tech Solutions | TechSol",
  meta_description: "Shop the latest gadgets...",
  og_image: "https://cdn.example.com/og/store.jpg"
}
```

### Admin Suspension

```typescript
{
  is_open: true,        // Vendor-controlled
  is_suspended: false,  // Admin-controlled
  // Effective state: isOperational = is_open && !is_suspended
}
```

## Error Codes Reference

| Code | HTTP Status | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 400 | Request body failed validation |
| `AUTH_MISSING_TOKEN` / `AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED` / `AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID` | 401 | Missing, expired or malformed token. ⚠ There is no `UNAUTHORIZED` code in the registry |
| `AUTH_ROLE_NOT_FOUND` / `AUTH_VENDOR_SUSPENDED` | 403 | Not signed in as an active vendor. ⚠ There is no `FORBIDDEN` code in the registry, and the immutable-field 403s above are unreachable |
| ~~`NOT_FOUND`~~ | ~~404~~ | **Not raised here.** The store is created on demand (`ensureStoreForVendor`), so there is no missing-store path. `NOT_FOUND` is reserved for unmatched routes |
| `STORE_SLUG_TAKEN` | 409 | Optimistic-locking version mismatch. ⚠ The code really is `STORE_SLUG_TAKEN` — see the warning above; there is no `CONFLICT` in the registry |
| `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` | 500 | Unexpected server error. ⚠ Not `INTERNAL_ERROR` |

---

## Security Best Practices

1. **Always use HTTPS** in production
2. **Store JWT tokens securely** (httpOnly cookies or secure storage)
3. **Never expose storeId** in vendor-facing routes (vendor-ID-only access)
4. **Implement rate limiting** on update endpoints
5. **Monitor for suspicious patterns** (rapid updates, abuse)
6. **Validate file uploads** for logo/banner (prevent malicious content)
7. **Sanitize HTML** in description field (prevent XSS)

---

## Example Workflows

### Update Store Name and Description

```bash
# 1. Get current store
curl -X GET https://api.example.com/api/vendor/store \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Response: { "data": { "version": 5, ... } }

# 2. Update store
curl -X PATCH https://api.example.com/api/vendor/store \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Awesome Store",
    "description": "We sell amazing products",
    "version": 5
  }'
```

### Enable Vacation Mode

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.example.com/api/vendor/store/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "isOpen": false,
    "version": 6
  }'
```

### Re-open Store After Vacation

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.example.com/api/vendor/store/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "isOpen": true,
    "version": 7
  }'
```

---

## Architectural Notes

### Vendor-ID-Only Access

Vendors **never** operate by storeId. Identity flow:

```
JWT Token → User → Vendor → Store
```

Repository methods:
- `findByVendorId(vendorId)` ← Vendor-facing
- `findById(storeId)` ← Internal/Admin-only

This enforces strong tenant isolation.

### One Store Per Vendor

**Current architecture**: `vendor_id` unique constraint.

**Future**: Multi-store support by removing unique constraint and adding store management UI.

### Provisioning (get-or-create)

Every vendor must have a store. It is created by `StoreProvisioningService` from
two paths: a best-effort hook when onboarding Step 1 completes, and get-or-create
on first access to any `/api/vendor/store` endpoint (which also heals accounts
that predate provisioning). Creation is race-safe via the unique `vendor_id`
index. A 404 can therefore only mean the **vendor profile** is missing — a
system bug.
