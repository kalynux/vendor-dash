# WhatsApp Templates

> ⛔ **INCIDENT, FOUND AND FIXED 2026-09-20 — THE TEMPLATES ARE APPROVED IN TWO LANGUAGES AND THE
> CODE ASKED FOR FIVE.** Every template send named the recipient's own language
> (`META_LANGUAGE_CODE[lang]`). Templates are approved in `en` and `fr` only, so for anyone whose
> language was **Portuguese, Spanish or Arabic** the send asked Meta for a template that does not
> exist and was refused.
>
> **Six sites carried the identical line**, and the two worst were not notifications at all:
>
> | Site | Consequence for a pt / es / ar user |
> |---|---|
> | `phone-verification.service.ts` | ⛔ **Could never verify a phone number. Ever.** That message is outside the 24-hour window **by nature** — the number being verified may never have written to us — so there is no free-form fallback. This was a **sign-up** defect on every stack, surfacing as a generic `PHONE_VERIFICATION_DELIVERY_FAILED` 502 that reads like a provider outage. |
> | `cod/delivery-code.service.ts` | The COD delivery code never arrived. Reached **only** after the free-form send already failed on `WHATSAPP_POLICY_VIOLATION`, so there was no third chance: an agent arrives with a parcel the customer cannot confirm. |
> | the four notification stacks (customer, vendor, agency, agent) | No WhatsApp notification outside the window — for customers **and** for vendors, agencies and agents. |
>
> ⚠ **Why it was invisible.** `template-registry.ts` registers every template in **all five**
> languages, so the code's own model of the world said the template existed. The refusal came
> back from Meta at send time, was caught, and was written to the notification row as a delivery
> error. Nothing alerted. ⚠ **That registry is still wrong** and is a separate change.
>
> **The fix**: `templateLanguage(lang)` in `notifications/catalog/notification-i18n.ts` — an
> explicit, named fallback to **English**, applied at all six sites, with `TEMPLATE_LANGUAGES`
> declaring what is actually approved. `test:customer-notifications` asserts that every one of
> the five bot languages resolves to a template that is genuinely in the submitted set —
> including the fallback itself, which catches the case of a set submitted in French but not
> English. ⚠ The fallback is the **literal** `'en'`, deliberately not `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`: they
> are the same value today and different ideas, and since French is approved, changing the
> platform default would have moved this fallback with nothing going red.
>
> The accepted cost, decided by the owner: an Arabic-reading customer gets an English delivery
> notice. **In-chat copy, email, Telegram and the in-app inbox remain five languages** — they
> need nobody's approval.

> ✅ **The WABA holds 190 templates** — the 94 notification names in `en` and `fr` (submitted
> 2026-09-14) plus the phone-verification pair (submitted and **approved** 2026-09-15). This
> replaces the "holds ZERO templates" measurement that stood here on 2026-09-14.
> Submit with `npm run whatsapp:templates:submit -- --submit`
> ([submit-whatsapp-templates.ts](../../scripts/submit-whatsapp-templates.ts)): it reads the WABA
> first and sends only the difference, so a re-run resumes rather than duplicating.
>
> ✅ **ALL 190 ARE APPROVED** — measured 2026-09-15. The 188 catalog templates cleared review
> roughly a day after submission.
>
> ✅ **THE 131037 DISPLAY-NAME BLOCKER IS CLOSED — 2026-09-16 — and it closed by REPLACING THE
> NUMBER, not by approving a name on the old one.** The sending number is now
> **`1263609603508344` (+237 652 705 926)**, `verified_name: "Wi-Mall"`,
> **`name_status: "APPROVED"`**. The block below stood here until that swap and described the
> real state at the time; it is kept only as the diagnostic order, because the gate it names
> still sits above every other WhatsApp precondition and a future number would meet it again.
>
> <details><summary>What the old number looked like (superseded 2026-09-16)</summary>
>
> `614443908428263` (+1 555-784-5447) reported `name_status: "NON_EXISTS"`,
> `new_name_status: "NONE"` and a leftover `verified_name` of `"Mrzenn"`, so a live send of the
> approved OTP template returned `(#131037) WhatsApp provided number needs display name approval
> before message can be sent.` — and a plain free-form text returned the identical error, *before*
> the 24-hour window was evaluated. Setting the name was impossible too: `POST
> /{phone_number_id}` with `new_display_name` answered **403, code 4, subcode 2593011**, the ten
> monthly display-name changes already spent with nothing pending. The recorded options were to
> wait for the rollover or to onboard a different number — **the second is what happened**, and a
> new number does take its display name at registration rather than out of that quota.
>
> </details>
>
> ⛔ **THE OLD PHONE ID IS GONE, NOT MERELY STALE.** `614443908428263` was removed from the WABA
> outright: `GET /614443908428263` now answers Graph **code 100, subcode 33**, *"object does not
> exist"*. So any deployment still holding it has a **dead** send path, not a degraded one —
> including the n8n automation layer, which reads `$env.WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` with **no
> fallback** in `UP-wi-mall-core` → `send whatsapp` and `UP-wi-mall-wa-adapter` → `typing
> (first)`. Two places hold this value and nothing compares them.
>
> ✅ **THE 190 TEMPLATES SURVIVED THE SWAP UNTOUCHED**, and that is the structural point worth
> keeping: **templates are WABA-scoped, sending is phone-scoped.** The WABA
> (`3361724037302135`, now named "Wi-Mall") did not change, so all 190 are still `APPROVED`,
> including both `wi_mall_phone_verification` rows — re-measured 2026-09-16. Changing the number
> costs no resubmission. ⚠ The converse is the trap: an approved **display name** *is*
> phone-scoped and does not move with the WABA, which is why the blocker above could not be
> carried over and had to be earned again on the new number.
>
> ✅ **THE SECOND PHONE-SCOPED GATE IS ALSO CLOSED — registered 2026-09-16.** A number can be
> verified and named and still send nothing: for a few hours this one read `status: "PENDING"`,
> `platform_type: "NOT_APPLICABLE"`, meaning **not registered on the Cloud API**. `POST
> /1263609603508344/register` (`messaging_product: whatsapp` + the six-digit two-step PIN)
> returned `{"success":true}`, and it now measures `status: "CONNECTED"`,
> `platform_type: "CLOUD_API"`, `quality_rating: "GREEN"`, `throughput.level: "STANDARD"`.
>
> ⚠ **Keep this gate in the diagnostic list even though it is closed.** It is invisible in every
> symptom a developer sees — the templates were approved, the token was valid, the display name
> was approved, and sending still failed — and it is **re-created by every future number change**,
> because registration is phone-scoped like the display name. It is an account action, not a code
> change; nothing in these three repositories can detect or report it.
>
> ⚠ **Check BOTH of these before diagnosing a delivery failure as a template problem** — one
> call, no side effects:
>
> ```
> GET /{phone_number_id}?fields=verified_name,name_status,new_name_status,status,platform_type
> ```
>
> `name_status: APPROVED` **and** `status: CONNECTED` are both required. Either one short means
> nothing sends, whatever else is fixed — and the errors point at the message, not at the number.
>
> ⛔ **PENDING is not APPROVED, and that distinction still matters for anything NEW.** ⚠ This is
> a TEMPLATE `status`, a different field from the phone-number `status` discussed directly above —
> same word, same value, different object, and only one of them is about review. A freshly
> submitted template is unsendable until Meta clears it, and this page cannot tell you the
> current state — poll `GET /{waba}/message_templates?fields=name,language,status`. ⚠ **A
> template's `category` while PENDING is not its final category either**; see the MARKETING note
> below, which this page got wrong by reading a mid-review value as a verdict.
>
> ## Phone verification — RESOLVED 2026-09-15, and the reason matters
>
> ✅ **`wi_mall_phone_verification` (AUTHENTICATION) is APPROVED in `en` and `fr`**
> (`4426347317613316`, `1393590468966788`). Out-of-window phone verification works. Meta
> approved both within seconds of submission, so there was no PENDING window to wait out.
>
> ⚠ **This page said the opposite one day earlier, and the earlier text was correct when
> written.** On 2026-09-14 the template could not be created at all — code 10, subcode 2388185 —
> because Meta gates the AUTHENTICATION category behind business verification and this WABA's
> owning business was `business_verification_status: "rejected"`. It reached **`verified`** on
> 2026-09-15, and the template created on the first attempt with **no code change**: the send
> path had always tried AUTHENTICATION first. The old diagnosis is kept below because it is what
> made the recovery a one-command operation.
>
> | Template | Category | Outcome |
> |---|---|---|
> | `wi_mall_phone_verification` | AUTHENTICATION | ✅ **APPROVED 2026-09-15**, `en` + `fr`. Uncreatable the previous day (code 10 / 2388185) purely because the owning business was unverified — **not the token**, since UTILITY created fine on the same credential, which is what isolated it. |
> | `wi_mall_phone_verification_utility` | UTILITY | ⛔ **REJECTED, permanently.** Created 2026-09-14 and refused at review within minutes, `INCORRECT_CATEGORY`, both languages. Both rows have since vanished from the WABA. |
>
> ⛔ **DO NOT RESUBMIT THE UTILITY ONE, and note that the verification did NOT revive it.** Its
> rejection is about OTP **content**, not about the business: resubmitting with
> `allow_category_change: true` — which lets Meta assign whatever category it judges correct
> rather than refusing — came back `REJECTED` **synchronously**. Meta classifies OTP content as
> AUTHENTICATION and accepts it nowhere else. Now that AUTHENTICATION is open, that is no longer
> a problem to solve; it is simply a name that must stay unsubmitted. **Do not reword the copy
> until the classifier stops recognising it** — that is evading enforcement rather than
> satisfying it, and the WABA carrying the other 189 templates is what would be at risk.
>
> Scope a submission with `--only=`, which matches the name exactly:
> `npm run whatsapp:templates:submit -- --only=wi_mall_phone_verification --submit` excludes the
> `_utility` name.
>
> ⚠ **What Meta froze into the approved template, and cannot be changed at send time:** the body
> (Meta writes and localises it), the footer *"Expires in 10 minutes."*, and a copy-code button
> compiled down to a **URL** button carrying
> `…/otp/code/?otp_type=COPY_CODE&code_expiration_minutes=10&code=otp{{1}}`. The send passes only
> the code, twice — body parameter and button parameter at `sub_type: 'url'`, `index: 0`. So
> **lowering `PHONE_VERIFY_TTL_SECONDS` does not change what the message promises**; the
> generator derives `code_expiration_minutes` from that variable and `test:phone-verification`
> § 6c fails if the two disagree, but an already-approved template can only be corrected by
> resubmitting under a new name — exactly like the button host.
>
> ⚠ **Meta OVERRIDES `UTILITY` → `MARKETING` on review, and the price is the smaller half of
> it.** **MARKETING is subject to marketing opt-out**, so a recipient who has opted out receives
> *nothing* for that situation — silently, with the notification recorded as sent.
>
> ⛔ **DO NOT TRUST A COUNT HERE, AND DO NOT TRUST A LIST — this page has now been wrong about
> this set twice.** It grew from 10 names to 12 during the first review window. **On 2026-09-15,
> with review COMPLETE, it settled at TWO — and not the same two.** The final set is
> `agency_agent_contract_rejected [fr]` and `vendor_storage_product_unsuspended [fr]`. Measure it
> instead — it is one command:
>
> ```bash
> curl -s "https://graph.facebook.com/v26.0/$WABA/message_templates?limit=200&fields=name,category" \
>   -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | tr ',' '\n' | grep -B1 MARKETING
> ```
>
> ✅ **The operationally alarming case did NOT survive review.**
> `agent_shipment_offer_received` and `agent_shipment_offer_reminder` — delivery **job offers**,
> where a marketing opt-out would have silently stopped an agent being offered work — came out
> **UTILITY**. This page asserted the opposite until 2026-09-15, having recorded a *mid-review*
> classification as the outcome. ⚠ **A category seen while `status` is `PENDING` is not a
> verdict**; Meta moves it during review. Re-read it once the template is `APPROVED`.
>
> The *shape* of the risk is the durable part: **anything that reads as a nudge rather than as a
> record of something that already happened** is a candidate for reclassification — plan-expiry
> warnings, the agency soft-cap warning, contract outcomes. Check any newly submitted name of
> that kind after it clears.
>
> The generator submits `UTILITY` for all of them — its own comment warns that MARKETING
> "makes the send subject to marketing opt-out" — and Meta reclassified them on review
> anyway. Changing that means rewording the **catalog** copy to read as strictly transactional
> and resubmitting under a NEW name: a name, once bound to a category, keeps it.
> `agency_agent_contract_rejected [fr]` had to be submitted as MARKETING for exactly that
> reason, after Meta reclassified its `en` twin.
>
> ⚠ **21 names carry a padded body, and the pad is load-bearing.** Meta refuses a body whose
> first or last element is a variable, and **counts neither the `*` bold markers nor a trailing
> full stop as content** — so `… for {{2}} {{3}}.` is refused, which its own error message does
> not say. 38 of the first 190 submissions died on this. The generator now appends a static
> closing line (or prefixes the heading), leaving the catalog-derived sentence untouched; the
> same pad fixes the sibling refusal, "too many variables relative to its length".
>
> 📌 **The submittable payloads are GENERATED, not transcribed from this page.**
> `npx ts-node scripts/generate-whatsapp-templates.ts` derives every body from the catalogs
> themselves — real localised copy, with `{{n}}` placed by index in the array
> `render*WhatsAppTemplateParams` actually returns. Output:
> [`whatsapp-template-payloads.json`](./whatsapp-template-payloads.json) (94 templates ×
> en/fr = 188 submissions).
>
> **Use the generator, not this page, when creating templates.** Meta substitutes
> positionally, so a hand-typed body whose `{{2}}` sits where the code puts `{{1}}` is not
> rejected — it silently sends the wrong value in that slot on every message. This page stays
> as the human-readable reference for copy and approval status; the JSON is what gets
> submitted.
>
> Two things the generator enforces and this page cannot: it **fails** if a body quotes a real
> value the send does not pass (that defect existed in six situations and is now fixed in the
> catalogs), and it strips the ten optional clauses — `codLine`, `refundLine`, `reasonSuffix`
> and friends — which cannot be template parameters because they are frequently empty and
> **Meta rejects an empty parameter value**.

**Verified against source on 2026-09-08** — the registry census (**65** registered names), the
five language codes, and `vendor_booking_created`'s five body params, against
`jovi-mall/src/modules/whatsapp/handlers/template/template-registry.ts`,
`src/core/constants/languages.ts` and the four catalogs under
`src/modules/notifications/catalog/` (**94** distinct template names referenced, **30** of them
never registered). Approval status is a Meta-side fact this page cannot verify.

This is the source-of-truth for the WhatsApp Business templates used by the
platform — vendor notifications (§1–7), the customer-facing COD delivery
code (§8), the cross-role **billing / plan-lifecycle** templates (§9), the
**agency** (§10) and **agent** (§11) notification templates, agency-warehoused
stock (§12), and the **customer** notification stack (§13). Create each template
in **WhatsApp Business Manager → Message Templates** exactly as
specified, in **all 5 languages**. Until a template is approved, out-of-24h-window
sends for that event will fail — for role notifications the failure is recorded on
the notification's `deliveryErrors` (never breaking the flow: in-app, push, email
and Telegram still deliver); for the COD code it is logged and the code simply
stays available in the customer's own order view (see
[customer/orders.md](../customer/orders.md#cod)).

Every template listed here is registered in
[template-registry.ts](../../src/modules/whatsapp/handlers/template/template-registry.ts)
with its name, the 5 language codes, and its expected body-param count — that
registry is the code-side checklist for this page, not an approval status. A
template registered here but not yet approved in Business Manager still fails on
send; approval is a Meta-side step.

> The button URL base is `VENDOR_APP_URL` for vendor templates. Agency and agent
> templates use `AGENCY_APP_URL` / `AGENT_APP_URL` respectively as their button
> base — configure each template's URL base to match the app it points at.

## Conventions

- **Category:** `UTILITY` for all (transactional, non-promotional).
- **Languages (Meta codes):** `en`, `fr`, `pt_PT`, `es`, `ar`.
- **Body placeholders** are positional: `{{1}}`, `{{2}}`, … mapped to the event
  context below.
- **Header:** static `TEXT` (no variables).
- **Button:** a single dynamic **URL** button. Configure the button URL base as
  your `VENDOR_APP_URL` value with a trailing `{{1}}`, e.g.
  `https://app.jovimall.com/{{1}}`. The backend sends the path suffix (e.g.
  `orders/ORDER_ID`) as the button parameter.
- In-window sends use the same copy as **free-form text / interactive CTA** (no
  approval needed); the localized strings live in
  [notification-catalog.ts](../../src/modules/notifications/catalog/notification-catalog.ts).
- **Field limits:** Meta caps button labels at 20 chars, header/footer at 60,
  body at 1024. The backend also hard-caps every field to these limits
  ([whatsapp-limits.ts](../../src/modules/whatsapp/constants/whatsapp-limits.ts)),
  but keep the template copy within them so nothing is truncated.

Languages are kept in sync with `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`
([core/constants/languages.ts](../../src/core/constants/languages.ts)).

- **Button:** URL → `bookings/{{bookingId}}`

> [!CAUTION]
> **CHANGED 2026-09-06 — 3 params → 5. This template must be EDITED AND RE-APPROVED in Business
> Manager, in all five languages, before the change deploys.** Until it is, Meta rejects every
> out-of-window send for this situation on a parameter-count mismatch and the failure is recorded
> on the notification's `deliveryErrors` — in-app, push, email and Telegram carry the new copy
> regardless, so the symptom is "WhatsApp specifically went quiet", one vendor at a time, in a log.
> `template-registry.ts` already says 5.

> [!NOTE]
> **What was wrong, and why the copy grew.** All three of the old parameters rendered EMPTY on
> every booking — the event never carried `bookingNumber`, `serviceName` or `startTime` under
> those names, so vendors received *"New booking # for scheduled on Invalid Date."* over every
> channel, and this template failed outright (Meta rejects an empty parameter). Fixing the three
> made the message correct; `{{3}}` and `{{5}}` make it **useful**, which was the other half of
> the ask. A vendor's first question is who booked, and their second is whether they have to do
> anything — a `manual`-mode booking is sitting waiting for them to accept it and the old copy
> never said so.

> [!NOTE]
> **`{{5}}` is a whole sentence, composed by the backend in the recipient's language.** It is one
> of exactly two values: *"It is waiting for you to confirm or decline it."* (the booking landed
> `pending`, i.e. the vendor's booking mode is `manual`) or *"It is already confirmed — nothing to
> do."*. It cannot be static template copy because which one applies is per-booking. The full
> wording for all five languages is in `vendor-notification-event-handler.service.ts`
> (`handleBookingCreated`) — keep the approved body's sentence spacing so the two read as one
> paragraph.

> [!NOTE]
> **Unlike five of the `customer_*` templates below, this body is DERIVED, not rewritten** — every
> placeholder in the in-window copy is a body param, so the approved template says exactly what the
> free-form message says. Keep it that way when editing: the moment a placeholder is added to the
> copy without being added to `bodyParams`, this template needs a hand-written substitute body and
> a ⚠ note like theirs. `npm run test:booking-notification` § 3 fails if that happens.

## 8. `wi_mall_delivery_code` — the COD delivery code (AUTHENTICATION, copy-code button)

✅ **APPROVED 2026-09-27**, `en` (`1764181271500924`) + `fr` (`3021733508157901`).

Sent by [`DeliveryCodeService`](../../src/modules/cod/services/delivery-code.service.ts) on the
customer's **notification channel** only (Telegram, email or WhatsApp — one, by the notification
stack's own rule). On WhatsApp it tries a **free message first** — the code, the order, the amount
and "only after you have your package" — and sends this template **only** when that is refused for
the 24-hour window. The same path serves every reissue: the agent's resend
(`resendCodeAsAgent`), the customer's, and a redelivery.

| Body | Meta's own, fixed and localised: "*{{1}}* is your verification code." / "Votre code de vérification est *{{1}}*." — **one** parameter, the code |
| `add_security_recommendation` | **false** — Meta's line is "do not share this code", and this code MUST be given to the delivery agent |
| Expiry footer | none — a delivery code does not expire in minutes |
| Button | COPY_CODE "Copy code" / "Copier le code". Meta compiles it to a **URL** button, so the send passes the code again as `sub_type: 'url'`, index 0 — exactly as phone verification |

⚠ **Out of window the customer receives the code alone.** Meta's authentication body cannot carry the
order or the amount; that context is in the free message whenever the window is open, and the
out-for-delivery notification names the cash amount.

⛔ **History — why it is AUTHENTICATION, and why the name changed.** The code was sent for months under
`cod_delivery_code`, which was never submitted (no catalogue held it, so the generator never emitted
it; the template-name parity guard in `test:customer-notifications` found it). Created as UTILITY on
2026-09-27 it was **REJECTED as `INCORRECT_CATEGORY`**, and a code-free UTILITY edit was rejected
again within seconds: to Meta a message whose purpose is a code is authentication, whatever it says.
A category cannot be changed by an edit, so the AUTHENTICATION template has a new name.
`cod_delivery_code` (en `1377264577810880`, fr `1603005295202926`) still sits REJECTED on the WABA and
nothing sends it; it can be deleted from WhatsApp Manager.

## 9. Billing / plan-lifecycle templates (all roles)

New with the cross-role billing engine. **Same copy across roles** for the plan
situations (only the template *name* differs per role, so each app can carry its
own button base). All use a single dynamic **URL** button → static suffix `plans`,
label **"Manage plan"** (fr *Gérer le forfait* · pt_PT *Gerir plano* · es *Gestionar
plan* · ar *إدارة الباقة*). Category `UTILITY`. The full 5-language body copy is the
source-of-truth in the catalogs — copy it verbatim when creating the templates:
[notification-catalog.ts](../../src/modules/notifications/catalog/notification-catalog.ts)
(vendor), [agency-notification-catalog.ts](../../src/modules/notifications/catalog/agency-notification-catalog.ts),
[agent-notification-catalog.ts](../../src/modules/notifications/catalog/agent-notification-catalog.ts).

| Template name | Role | Body params | English body (en) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `vendor_plan_expiring` | vendor | `{{1}}`=plan code, `{{2}}`=days left, `{{3}}`=expiry date | Your {{1}} plan expires in {{2}} day(s), on {{3}}. Renew or upgrade to avoid interruption. |
| `vendor_plan_expired` | vendor | `{{1}}`=expired plan code, `{{2}}`=new plan code | Your {{1}} plan has expired. You are now on the {{2}} plan. Renew or upgrade anytime from your plan settings. |
| `agency_plan_expiring` | agency | `{{1}}`, `{{2}}`, `{{3}}` (as above) | *(same as `vendor_plan_expiring`)* |
| `agency_plan_expired` | agency | `{{1}}`, `{{2}}` | *(same as `vendor_plan_expired`)* |
| `agent_plan_expiring` | agent | `{{1}}`, `{{2}}`, `{{3}}` | Your {{1}} plan expires in {{2}} day(s), on {{3}}. Renew or upgrade to keep your higher delivery limit. |
| `agent_plan_expired` | agent | `{{1}}`, `{{2}}` | Your {{1}} plan has expired. You are now on the {{2}} plan, which may lower how many deliveries you can hold at once. Upgrade anytime from your plan settings. |

### `agency_shipment_cap_exceeded` (agency only)

Soft-cap monitoring alert (deliveries are never blocked). Header **"Shipment limit reached"**, button → `plans` ("Manage plan").

- **Body params:** `{{1}}`=current active shipments, `{{2}}`=plan code, `{{3}}`=cap

| Lang | Body |
|---|---|
| en | You have {{1}} active shipments, at or above your {{2}} plan limit of {{3}}. Deliveries keep flowing — upgrade for more headroom. |
| fr | Vous avez {{1}} expéditions actives, au niveau ou au-dessus de la limite de {{3}} de votre forfait {{2}}. Les livraisons continuent — améliorez votre forfait pour plus de marge. |
| pt_PT | Tem {{1}} remessas ativas, no limite ou acima do limite de {{3}} do seu plano {{2}}. As entregas continuam — faça upgrade para mais margem. |
| es | Tienes {{1}} envíos activos, en o por encima del límite de {{3}} de tu plan {{2}}. Las entregas continúan — mejora tu plan para más margen. |
| ar | لديك {{1}} شحنة نشطة، عند حد باقة {{2}} البالغ {{3}} أو أعلى منه. تستمر عمليات التوصيل — قم بالترقية لمزيد من السعة. |

> Until these are approved, plan/cap notifications still reach the recipient via **in-app + push + email/Telegram** — only the WhatsApp channel (outside the 24h window) waits on approval.

## 10. Agency templates

Button base: **`AGENCY_APP_URL`**. Category `UTILITY`, 5 languages, single dynamic
URL button unless stated. The **full 5-language body + button copy is the
source-of-truth in
[agency-notification-catalog.ts](../../src/modules/notifications/catalog/agency-notification-catalog.ts)** —
copy it verbatim when creating each template; the English body below is the
reference for what the params mean. Plan templates (`agency_plan_expiring`,
`agency_plan_expired`) and `agency_shipment_cap_exceeded` are specified in §9.

| Template name | Body params | Button suffix · label (en) | English body |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agency_connection_request_received` | `{{1}}`=vendor name | `vendor-connections/{{connectionId}}` · View connection | {{1}} wants to connect with you as their delivery partner. |
| `agency_connection_approved` | `{{1}}`=vendor name | `vendor-connections/{{connectionId}}` · View connection | {{1}} approved your connection request. You can now deliver for them. |
| `agency_connection_rejected` | `{{1}}`=vendor name | `vendor-connections/{{connectionId}}` · View connection | {{1}} declined your connection request. |
| `agency_connection_reapproval_needed` | `{{1}}`=vendor name | `vendor-connections/{{connectionId}}` · View connection | {{1}} updated their policies. Reapprove your connection to keep delivering for them. |
| `agency_shipment_assigned` | `{{1}}`=order number, `{{2}}`=item count | `shipments/{{shipmentId}}` · View shipment | Order #{{1}} was dispatched to you — {{2}} item(s) to fulfill. |
| `agency_shipment_offer_accepted` | `{{1}}`=agent name, `{{2}}`=order number | `shipments/{{shipmentId}}` · View shipment | {{1}} accepted the delivery for order #{{2}}. They are on the way. |
| `agency_shipment_assignment_unfilled` | `{{1}}`=order number | `shipments/{{shipmentId}}` · View shipment | No agent took the delivery for order #{{1}}. Assign an agent manually to keep it moving. |
| `agency_payout_requested` | `{{1}}`=currency, `{{2}}`=amount | `tickets/{{ticketId}}` · View ticket | Your request to withdraw {{1}} {{2}} was created. Track its progress under Tickets. |
| `agency_payout_paid` | `{{1}}`=currency, `{{2}}`=amount | `tickets/{{ticketId}}` · View ticket | Your payout of {{1}} {{2}} has been paid. |
| `agency_payout_rejected` | `{{1}}`=currency, `{{2}}`=amount | `tickets/{{ticketId}}` · View ticket | Your request to withdraw {{1}} {{2}} was rejected. See Tickets for the reason. |
| ⭐ `agency_payout_transfer_failed` | `{{1}}`=currency, `{{2}}`=amount | `tickets/{{ticketId}}` · View ticket | We hit a problem sending your {{1}} {{2}}. The money is safe and still reserved for this payout — our team is on it and will retry. Nothing is needed from you; see Tickets for progress. |
| `agency_cod_deposit_declared` | `{{1}}`=agent name, `{{2}}`=currency, `{{3}}`=amount, `{{4}}`=deadline days | `cod/deposits/{{depositId}}` · Review deposit | {{1}} declared a cash deposit of {{2}} {{3}}. Confirm or reject it within {{4}} days — unanswered declarations freeze your reserve releases. |
| `agency_cod_deposit_direct_to_platform` | `{{1}}`=agent name, `{{2}}`=currency, `{{3}}`=amount | `cod/deposits/{{depositId}}` · Review deposit | {{1}} paid {{2}} {{3}} of collected cash straight to the platform. Your liability has been reduced by the same amount and the collections it covers are settled — nothing is owed to you for it. |
| `agency_storage_alert` | `{{1}}`=percent used, `{{2}}`=usage, `{{3}}`=limit | `settings/storage` (static) · Manage storage | *(same copy as `vendor_storage_alert`, §7)* |

### 10a. Agent-contract templates (agency side)

The agency's half of the agent↔agency contract. Button suffix is `agents/{{contractId}}` · **View
contract** for all eight. See [Agent roster](../agency/agent-roster.md#notifications).

| Template name | Body params | English body |
|---|---|---|
| `agency_agent_contract_request_received` | `{{1}}`=agent name | {{1}} applied to deliver for you. |
| `agency_agent_contract_approved` | `{{1}}`=agent name | {{1}} accepted your request. |
| `agency_agent_contract_rejected` | `{{1}}`=agent name | {{1}} declined your request. |
| `agency_agent_contract_status_request_raised` | `{{1}}`=agent name, `{{2}}`=transition label | {{1}} wants to {{2}}. It does not take effect until you answer — open the request to approve or decline it. |
| `agency_agent_contract_status_request_resolved` | `{{1}}`=agent name, `{{2}}`=transition label, `{{3}}`=resolution label | The request for {{1}} to {{2}} was {{3}}. |
| `agency_agent_contract_terms_countered` | `{{1}}`=agent name | {{1}} has countered the terms of your pending contract. Review what they are asking, then accept it, decline it, or counter again. |
| `agency_agent_contract_terms_proposed` | `{{1}}`=agent name | {{1}} has proposed a change to their contract. **The current terms stay in force until you answer** — nothing changes unless you accept. Open it to review, accept, decline or counter. |
| `agency_agent_contract_terms_resolved` | `{{1}}`=agent name, `{{2}}`=resolution label | The proposed change to the contract with {{1}} was {{2}}. Open the contract to see the terms now in force. |

**Label params are pre-localized by the server**, not enum values — `{{2}}` on
`status_request_raised` arrives as "end your contract" / "mettre fin à votre contrat" in the
recipient's language, and the resolution label as "accepted" / "declined" / "withdrawn" / "replaced
by a counter-offer". Do not translate them inside the template; the body around them is what varies
per language.

Headers are static `TEXT` — use the situation's `subject` from the catalog
(e.g. *New connection request*, *Deposit awaiting your confirmation*).

## 11. Agent templates

Button base: **`AGENT_APP_URL`**. Same conventions as §10; source-of-truth copy in
[agent-notification-catalog.ts](../../src/modules/notifications/catalog/agent-notification-catalog.ts).
Plan templates (`agent_plan_expiring`, `agent_plan_expired`) are in §9.

| Template name | Body params | Button suffix · label (en) | English body |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agent_cod_deposit_recorded` | `{{1}}`=agency name, `{{2}}`=currency, `{{3}}`=amount | `cod/deposits/{{depositId}}` · View deposit | {{1}} recorded a cash deposit of {{2}} {{3}} from you. Your balance has been reduced by that amount. If this is not what you handed over, report it now. |
| `agent_cod_deposit_confirmed` | `{{1}}`=currency, `{{2}}`=amount, `{{3}}`=confirmed-by name | `cod/deposits/{{depositId}}` · View deposit | Your deposit of {{1}} {{2}} was confirmed by {{3}}. Your balance has been reduced and your COD limit freed up. |
| `agent_cod_deposit_rejected` | `{{1}}`=confirmed-by name, `{{2}}`=currency, `{{3}}`=amount, `{{4}}`=rejection reason | `cod/deposits/{{depositId}}` · View deposit | {{1}} rejected your declared deposit of {{2}} {{3}}. Reason: {{4}}. The cash is still on your balance and your deposit deadline is running again — sort this out with them, or report it. |
| `agent_shipment_offer_received` | `{{1}}`=agency name, `{{2}}`=order number | `offers/{{offerId}}` · Review offer | {{1}} is offering you a delivery for order {{2}}. Review and accept it before it expires. |
| `agent_shipment_offer_reminder` | `{{1}}`=agency name, `{{2}}`=order number | `offers/{{offerId}}` · Review offer | Your delivery offer from {{1}} for order {{2}} is still open. Accept it now before another agent takes it. |
| `agent_shipment_offer_expired` | `{{1}}`=agency name, `{{2}}`=order number | `offers/{{offerId}}` · Review offer | The delivery offer from {{1}} for order {{2}} expired because it wasn't accepted in time. |
| `agent_shipment_reassigned_away` | `{{1}}`=order number, `{{2}}`=agency name | **none** | The delivery for order {{1}} has been reassigned to another agent by {{2}}. You are no longer responsible for it, and its customer and tracking details are no longer available to you. It stays in your activity history. |
| `agent_storage_alert` | `{{1}}`=percent used, `{{2}}`=usage, `{{3}}`=limit | `settings/storage` (static) · Manage storage | *(same copy as `vendor_storage_alert`, §7)* |
| ⭐ `agent_payout_requested` | `{{1}}`=currency, `{{2}}`=amount | `earnings` (static) · View earnings | Your request to withdraw {{1}} {{2}} was created. You will hear from us when it is paid. |
| ⭐ `agent_payout_paid` | `{{1}}`=currency, `{{2}}`=amount | `earnings` (static) · View earnings | Your payout of {{1}} {{2}} has been paid. |
| ⭐ `agent_payout_rejected` | `{{1}}`=currency, `{{2}}`=amount | `earnings` (static) · View earnings | Your request to withdraw {{1}} {{2}} was rejected. The money is back in your available balance — open your earnings to see why, and you can request again. |
| ⭐ `agent_payout_transfer_failed` | `{{1}}`=currency, `{{2}}`=amount | `earnings` (static) · View earnings | We hit a problem sending your {{1}} {{2}}. Your money is safe and still reserved for this payout — our team is on it and will retry. There is nothing you need to do. |

⭐ **The four `agent_payout_*` templates are NEW and not yet submitted.** They close a total
gap: `agent-notification-event-consumer.ts` subscribed to **no** `payout.*` event, so an agent
requested their money and heard nothing in any channel. `agent_payout_transfer_failed` is new
for all three roles — the event was published and consumed by nobody.

⚠ **`agent_payout_rejected` and `agent_payout_transfer_failed` must not be confused when
reviewing copy.** Rejected **returns** the money and invites another request. Failed leaves it
**held**, is not terminal, and must **not** invite a retry — the owner would get a `409`. The
two read similarly in a list and mean opposite things to the person waiting.

⚠ `earnings` carries **no** placeholder, unlike the vendor and agency payout buttons which use
`tickets/{{ticketId}}`. The agent app has no tickets screen, and an agent has at most one open
payout request, so the summary is unambiguous. It is a **new** entry in the agent app's
deep-link vocabulary — see [deep-links.md](./deep-links.md#agent--agent_app-flutter).

### 11a. Agent-contract templates (agent side)

The agent's half — the mirror of §10a with the agency named instead. Button suffix is
`memberships/{{contractId}}` · **View contract** for all eight. See
[Agency membership](../agent/agency-membership.md#notifications).

| Template name | Body params | English body |
|---|---|---|
| `agent_contract_request_received` | `{{1}}`=agency name | {{1}} wants you to deliver for them. |
| `agent_contract_approved` | `{{1}}`=agency name | {{1}} approved your application. |
| `agent_contract_rejected` | `{{1}}`=agency name | {{1}} declined your application. |
| `agent_contract_status_request_raised` | `{{1}}`=agency name, `{{2}}`=transition label | {{1}} wants to {{2}}. It does not take effect until you answer — open the request to approve or decline it. |
| `agent_contract_status_request_resolved` | `{{1}}`=transition label, `{{2}}`=agency name, `{{3}}`=resolution label | The request to {{1}} with {{2}} was {{3}}. |
| `agent_contract_terms_countered` | `{{1}}`=agency name | {{1}} has changed the terms of your pending contract. Review what they are offering, then accept it, decline it, or counter again. |
| `agent_contract_terms_proposed` | `{{1}}`=agency name | {{1}} has proposed a change to your contract. **Your current terms stay in force until you answer** — nothing changes unless you accept. Open it to review, accept, decline or counter. |
| `agent_contract_terms_resolved` | `{{1}}`=agency name, `{{2}}`=resolution label | The proposed change to your contract with {{1}} was {{2}}. Open the contract to see the terms now in force. |

> **Param order differs between the two sides** — `agent_contract_status_request_resolved` takes the
> transition label first, its agency twin takes the name first. Copy each from its catalog rather
> than assuming symmetry.
>
> The "stays in force until you answer" clause in `terms_proposed` is **load-bearing copy**, not
> padding. A live terms proposal changes nothing on its own; a recipient who assumes it already
> applied will act on the wrong rate. Keep it in every language.

> **Static-header caveat:** the in-app subject for `cod.deposit.recorded` is
> *"Deposit recorded by {{agencyName}}"*, but a template header must be static —
> create that template's header as **"Deposit recorded"**. The agency name is
> already the first body param, so nothing is lost.

---

## 12. Agency-warehoused stock templates

> **"Storage" here means a WAREHOUSE**, not the media-file quota. `vendor_storage_alert`
> (§7) and `agency_storage_alert` (§10) are the quota ones. These nine are about physical
> goods on an agency's shelves. Do not merge the two families.

All nine carry a URL button. Base URL is `VENDOR_APP_URL` for the `vendor_*` templates
and `AGENCY_APP_URL` for the `agency_*` ones.

### 12a. Stock adjustment requests (both sides)

Neither the vendor nor the agency may change `variant.stock` on a warehoused SKU alone;
one proposes and the other approves. Each side gets the same three situations from its own
point of view.

| Template | Body params | Button suffix |
|---|---|---|
| `agency_storage_stock_request_received` | `vendorName`, `productTitle`, `sku`, `quantityBefore`, `requestedQuantity` | `stock-requests/{{requestId}}` |
| `agency_storage_stock_request_approved` | `vendorName`, `productTitle`, `sku`, `requestedQuantity` | `stock-requests/{{requestId}}` |
| `agency_storage_stock_request_rejected` | `vendorName`, `productTitle`, `sku`, `quantityBefore` | `stock-requests/{{requestId}}` |
| `vendor_storage_stock_request_received` | `agencyName`, `requestedQuantity`, `productTitle`, `sku`, `quantityBefore` | `stock-requests/{{requestId}}` |
| `vendor_storage_stock_request_approved` | `agencyName`, `productTitle`, `sku`, `requestedQuantity` | `stock-requests/{{requestId}}` |
| `vendor_storage_stock_request_rejected` | `agencyName`, `productTitle`, `sku`, `quantityBefore` | `stock-requests/{{requestId}}` |

> **Every `received` body carries BOTH quantities, and the order differs between the two
> sides.** Note `vendor_storage_stock_request_received` puts `requestedQuantity` second
> (the agency *counted* n) while the agency's puts `quantityBefore` fourth (the vendor
> wants to go *from* n *to* m). Copy the param order from the table, not from the other
> side's template.
>
> Both numbers are **load-bearing copy**: the decision the recipient has to make is "is 90
> right, or is 120?", and a body naming only the new figure forces them to go and look up
> the old one before they can answer.

### 12b. Things the agency did alone (vendor only)

No vendor decision to make — where the goods sit and whether the rent was paid are the
agency's own business — but a suspension takes the product off the storefront, and the
vendor must not discover that from their sales figures.

| Template | Body params | Button suffix |
|---|---|---|
| `vendor_storage_depot_changed` | `agencyName`, `productTitle`, `locationSuffix` | `products/{{productId}}` |
| `vendor_storage_product_suspended` | `agencyName`, `productTitle`, `noteSuffix` | `products/{{productId}}` |
| `vendor_storage_product_unsuspended` | `agencyName`, `productTitle` | `products/{{productId}}` |

> **`locationSuffix` and `noteSuffix` are pre-composed, including their own leading
> separator.** The backend sends `" (Bonabéri branch)"` or `""`, and
> `" Their note: “Storage unpaid since June”."` or `""`. That is deliberate: an unnamed
> depot or an absent note would otherwise render dangling punctuation ("…to a different
> warehouse ."). When creating these templates, place the placeholder **immediately
> after** the preceding word with no space or bracket of your own.

### Copy, all five languages

`en` / `fr` / `pt_PT` / `es` / `ar`, as with every other family here. Take the exact
strings from `NOTIFICATION_CATALOG` (`notification-catalog.ts`) and
`AGENCY_NOTIFICATION_CATALOG` (`agency-notification-catalog.ts`) — those are the source
of truth, and the in-app bodies and the template bodies must read the same.

> **Suspension copy must state the consequence plainly.** `storage.product_suspended`
> says "so customers can no longer buy it" in every language. A vendor who reads it as an
> administrative note will not act, and the product stays unsellable.

## 13. Customer templates (the fourth notification stack)

⚠ **These twenty-two were registered in code and documented NOWHERE until 2026-08-26**, which
is the same thing as not existing: an unapproved template fails on send, and a template nobody
wrote down never gets approved. GAP-012's own warning is exactly this — *"a template registered
in code but not approved in Business Manager still fails on send"* — so the customer stack had
the machinery and no approved templates to use it with. Create all twenty-two, in all five
languages, before relying on any proactive customer message.

> **Button URL base:** `STOREFRONT_URL`, not `VENDOR_APP_URL` — these point a *customer* at
> their own order, booking or support request. Configure each template's URL base as your
> `STOREFRONT_URL` with a trailing `{{1}}`; the backend sends the path suffix shown under
> **Button** as the button parameter.

**Which of these actually matter.** Payments settle in minutes and stay inside the 24-hour
service window, so their free-form copy usually does the work. The ones that *cannot* be
delivered any other way are the ones whose event lands days later:
`customer_order_shipped`, `customer_order_out_for_delivery`, `customer_order_delivered`,
`customer_order_delivery_failed`, `customer_booking_reminder`, and the three
`customer_ticket_*` templates. Approve those first.

⚠ **The body below is the TEMPLATE body, and for eleven situations it is shorter than the
in-window copy.** Those carry a handler-substituted clause — `{{confirmationLine}}`,
`{{codLine}}`, `{{reasonLine}}`, `{{refundLine}}` and friends — that is **not** in
`bodyParams` and therefore cannot travel in a template at all; Meta rejects a body containing
an unbound placeholder. Out-of-window those customers get the shorter sentence, which is the
accepted cost of the template mechanism rather than a defect.

> ### ⚠ Five of those eleven had to be REWRITTEN rather than shortened, and it is a finding
>
> On six of the eleven the missing clause is trailing, so dropping it leaves a correct
> sentence. On **five it sits mid-sentence**, and simply removing it produces copy that is
> ungrammatical — *"We received your XAF 24000 payment for order ORD-1. is preparing it
> now."* — or, on `booking.balance.due`, actively **wrong**: two different amounts collapse
> onto one parameter and the sentence claims something untrue about the money.
>
> Those five carry a **⚠ Rewritten, not derived** note and a hand-written body that says as
> much as its declared parameters allow. They are the five whose `bodyParams` do not cover
> their own copy: `booking.reminder`, `booking.payment.received`, `booking.balance.due`,
> `order.created`, `order.payment.received`.
>
> **The honest fix is to widen `bodyParams` on those five** so a template can say what the
> in-window copy says. It was NOT done here, deliberately: changing an approved template's
> parameter count is a Business Manager operation, and doing it blind — from a repository
> that cannot see what is approved — risks breaking a template that already works. Raise it
> as its own change, with the approval state in front of you.

⚠ **`customer_order_payment_link` is the only one here that is not raised by a platform
event.** The automation layer raises it through `messaging_notify_customer`, and its button
points at a **payment page**, not at a record the customer already owns. See
[n8n/bot-surface.md § 13](../n8n/bot-surface.md).

⚠ **`{{2}}` on `customer_ticket_resolved` is a whole sentence, not a value** — whether the
customer may still reply depends on resolved-vs-closed, so it travels as a parameter rather
than being baked into the approved body, which would make one of the two outcomes a lie.

The tables below are rendered from
[customer-notification-catalog.ts](../../src/modules/notifications/catalog/customer-notification-catalog.ts).
`npm run test:customer-notifications` asserts that every registered `customer_*` template
name appears on this page, so a situation added without its approval copy fails the suite.

### `customer_booking_created`

- **Body params:** `{{1}}`=serviceName, `{{2}}`=vendorName, `{{3}}`=startAt

⚠ **Rewritten, not derived.** The in-window copy carries `{{whenPhrase}}` ("tomorrow" / "later today"), which is not a body param — the template says the time plainly instead.

### `customer_booking_payment_received`

- **Situation:** `booking.payment.received`
- **Body params:** `{{1}}`=currency, `{{2}}`=amountFormatted, `{{3}}`=serviceName, `{{4}}`=startAt
- **Button:** URL → `bookings/{{bookingId}}`

⚠ **Corrected 2026-09-16: this line used to list THREE body params, and there are FOUR.** Measured
against `whatsapp-template-payloads.json` — the file that was actually submitted — whose body for
this template carries `{{1}}`–`{{4}}`, and against the catalogue's `bodyParams`, which sends four.
A reader trusting the old line would "fix" the catalogue down to three, and a send whose parameter
count disagrees with the approved template is refused by WhatsApp outright. The tables below are
the in-window rendering and still omit the time; the approved template includes it.

⚠ **Not reused for a BALANCE payment.** The copy ends *"see you then"*, which is false after the
appointment has happened, and approved template text cannot be edited without a new approval. A
balance payment stays unannounced pending the proactive-message design (see
`booking.payment_failed` below, which was written to be true for both).

- **Button:** URL → `bookings/{{bookingId}}/pay-balance`

⚠ **Rewritten, not derived, and this one was WRONG rather than merely incomplete.** The in-window copy names `{{finalPriceFormatted}}` and `{{reasonLine}}`, neither of which is a body param, and stripping them left `{{3}}` reading as two different amounts in one sentence. The template states only the balance, which is what the four parameters can actually say.

### `customer_order_payment_failed`

⚠ **NEW — submitted separately from the 188, and not yet approved.** Added 2026-09-16 to close
a silence rather than to add a feature: a declined or unapproved charge previously told the
customer *nothing*, so a failed payment was indistinguishable from a successful one that had
gone quiet. Submit it with the same command as the rest; it reads the WABA first and sends only
the difference.

⚠ **The copy must not say the order is cancelled, because it is not.** The basket survives and
the charge is retryable. It also blames nobody — the usual causes here are an unapproved push
prompt and a timeout, neither of which is a judgement on the customer's money.

- **Situation:** `order.payment_failed`
- **Body params:** `{{1}}`=currency, `{{2}}`=amountFormatted, `{{3}}`=orderNumber
- **Button:** URL → `shop/account/orders/detail/{{orderId}}` — the order page, where the retry
  lives. Deliberately **not** a fresh pay link: at failure time there may be no valid token to
  mint one from, and a button opening a dead payment page is worse than one opening the order.

### `customer_booking_payment_failed`

⚠ **NEW — generated locally, NOT submitted.** Added 2026-09-16 to close the order silence one
product type over: an online booking payment was never announced in either direction. Success
published an event only the vendor stack heard, and failure published nothing, so a customer whose
mobile-money prompt timed out turned up for an appointment the vendor saw as unpaid. Submission is
the owner's decision at the end of the round.

⚠ **One sentence, true for the original price AND a balance paid after the appointment** — which is
why it carries no time and no "see you then". It never says the booking is cancelled (a failed
charge cancels nothing) and blames nobody.

- **Situation:** `booking.payment_failed`
- **Fires:** only where the gateway gave a verdict — webhook, or verify (which the reconciliation
  sweep uses) — on the transition into FAILED/CANCELLED. Never from the gateway-call catch, where a
  timeout cannot be told from a refusal and a charge may still be live.
- **Body params:** `{{1}}`=currency, `{{2}}`=amountFormatted, `{{3}}`=serviceName
- **Button:** URL → `shop/account/bookings/{{bookingId}}` — the booking page, mirroring the order
  entry's reasoning: at failure time there may be no valid token to mint a pay link from.

### `customer_booking_balance_received`

⚠ **NEW — generated locally, NOT submitted.** Added 2026-09-20 (phase 10, stage 1). Submission is
the owner's decision, together with the rest of the stage-2 set.

⭐ **It closes the last silence in the booking payment set, and the silence was deliberate.**
`handleBookingPaymentReceived` returned early on a balance rather than reuse
`customer_booking_payment_received`, whose copy ends *"Nothing else to do — see you then"*. A
balance is settled **after** the appointment, so that sentence points at a visit that already
happened — and avoiding the false wording by saying nothing left a customer who had just paid with
no confirmation at all. The fix is a second template, not a looser sentence.

⚠ **No time, no future tense.** Every word is about money that has arrived. It states the booking
is now **fully paid**, which is the customer's actual question and the closing half of
`customer_booking_balance_due`.

- **Situation:** `booking.balance.received`
- **Fires:** on `payment.received` with `aggregateType: 'booking'` and `purpose: 'booking_balance'`
  — the branch that used to `return`. The original price keeps
  `customer_booking_payment_received`.

## 14. Phase 10 · STAGE 2 — quick-reply buttons on the approved templates

✅ **BUILT AND SUBMITTED 2026-09-27** — the send path fills every template quick reply with an
explicit payload, and the eleven templates below were edited on the WABA the same day (PENDING
review at the time of writing). **Not yet proven by a live send** — see § 14.6. What follows was
written 2026-09-20 as the specification and is kept as the reasoning.

~~NOT BUILT AND NOT SUBMITTED. This section is the specification, written 2026-09-20 so the
decision can be taken with the cost visible.~~ Stage 1 (chat quick replies on Telegram and on
WhatsApp *inside* the 24-hour window) is built and green; it required no Meta involvement at all.
Stage 2 is the same button vocabulary projected onto the **approved templates**, which is the only
way a proactive button reaches a customer **outside** the window.

Every claim here is marked **[src]** (verified in this repository), **[meta]** (verified in Meta's
published documentation) or **[assumption]**.

### 14.1 Two code blockers, both in `src/modules/whatsapp/**`

⚠ **A template quick-reply payload cannot be sent today, and the module looks as though it can.**
`sub_type: 'quick_reply'` is already in the type union
([`whatsapp-message.types.ts:116`](../../src/modules/whatsapp/types/whatsapp-message.types.ts))
— but:

| # | Blocker | Where | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `TemplateParameter.type` has no `'payload'` | `whatsapp-message.types.ts:124` **[src]** | will not compile |
| 2 | the runtime validator carries the same list as a **hardcoded allowlist and throws** | `template-validator.ts:127` **[src]** | casting past `tsc` still fails with `WHATSAPP_INVALID_PAYLOAD`, before Meta is called |

This is the effort's failure mode 1 — *registered, validated, and never reached*. The fix is two
lines (add `'payload'` to both lists, plus `payload?: string` on `TemplateParameter`). It was
deliberately **left unbuilt**: it is inert until a quick-reply template actually exists, so
landing it speculatively would add an untested path to a module no stream owns.

### 14.2 Meta's rules that shape the design

- A template may mix quick-reply and URL buttons, but **all quick replies must be consecutive and
  all non-quick-replies consecutive** — alternating them is rejected as an invalid combination
  **[meta]**.
- Caps: **10 buttons total, 2 URL, 10 quick reply** **[meta]**.
- ⚠ **Templates with 4+ buttons, or a quick-reply/other mix, do not render on WhatsApp desktop**
  **[meta]**. This is the binding constraint, not the caps: it holds a template to **1 URL + 2
  quick replies**.
- **Editing an approved template requires re-approval** **[meta]**. So stage 2 is a resubmission
  of every template that gains a button, in every language it is approved in.

### 14.3 ⛔ Always send an explicit payload

Meta's webhook reference documents a template quick-reply tap as `messages[0].type === "button"`
with `button.payload` and `button.text`, and describes `button.payload` as carrying the **button
label text** **[meta]**. It does *not* state what arrives when no payload parameter was supplied at
send time — **[assumption]**: the label.

**So every quick-reply button must be sent with an explicit `payload` parameter, and the tap
dispatcher must treat any payload that is not a well-formed token as the stale/unknown button.**
That rule is correct whether the assumption holds or not, and it is the one the n8n side has
already been given: the WhatsApp adapter forwards `button.payload` verbatim — no trim, no case
change **[src, confirmed by the n8n spec session]** — so a visible label such as `Try again` would
otherwise arrive where a verb is expected.

### 14.4 What each template gains

⛔ **CORRECTED 2026-09-27 — this table used to list 13 situations and a button set the code does
not ship.** It was the pre-revision draft: three of its rows had no `actions` in the catalogue at
all (`customer_booking_confirmed`, `customer_booking_completed`, `customer_booking_reminder` —
their verbs have no handler), and three listed a button withdrawn before shipping (`That works`,
`Where is it now`, and `Leave a review`, which has since been restored — see below). **Never
submit from a table in this file; derive the set from the catalogue.** The measured record is
[`PROACTIVE-MESSAGES-PLAN.md`](PROACTIVE-MESSAGES-PLAN.md) § 3.

The vocabulary is defined once, in `actions` on the customer catalog
([`customer-notification-catalog.ts`](../../src/modules/notifications/catalog/customer-notification-catalog.ts)),
and stage 1 already renders it. The table below is what that catalogue ships **as of 2026-09-27**,
limited by the desktop-rendering rule (1 URL + at most 2 quick replies). Every other customer
template is **untouched**. `test:bot-surface` § 20 proves each token reaches a handler.

| Template | Quick replies to add (after the existing URL button) |
|---|---|
| `customer_booking_rescheduled` | Ask to change |
| `customer_booking_cancelled` | Book again — **an open owner decision** (plan Q-4) |
| `customer_booking_payment_failed` | Try again |
| `customer_order_payment_failed` | Try again |
| `customer_order_shipped` | Order details |
| `customer_order_delivered` | Leave a review · Something's wrong |
| `customer_order_delivery_failed` | I was not there · My address is wrong |
| `customer_ticket_replied` | Reply here |
| `customer_ticket_awaiting_customer` | Reply here |
| `customer_ticket_resolved` | Not sorted |

⚠ **`Leave a review` (`rate:<orderId>`) was withdrawn and is back.** `rate` was unrouted when the
withdrawal was written. It has been routed since `c39bff7` (2026-09-21, `REVIEW_ACTION_HANDLERS`).
It stays withdrawn on `booking.completed`: the rate handler resolves an order, and a booking has none.

⚠ `customer_order_delivery_failed` sits **exactly at** the desktop limit: URL + two quick replies.
"Where is it now" was removed before shipping because the URL button already says "Track
delivery", and it must not come back: a third quick reply would stop the message rendering on
WhatsApp desktop.

⚠ `customer_ticket_resolved`'s button is **conditional at send time**, not in the template: it is
suppressed for a *closed* request by omitting the id its token carries. A template cannot express
that, so the button is present in the approved template and simply not sent for a closed request —
which Meta permits, since button parameters are supplied per send.

### 14.5 The submission set, and what gates it

⛔ **EVERYTHING HERE IS SUBMITTED IN ENGLISH AND FRENCH ONLY. Nothing in stage 2 assumes a
five-language submission, and nothing in it should ever be changed to.** The owner has ruled
that Portuguese, Spanish and Arabic are **prepared, not served** — the platform is French and
English for now. Those three resolve to English through `templateLanguage()`, so they are
already reachable and need **no** template of their own. Submitting five languages would roughly
double the round for three languages nobody is served in yet.

*(This section previously listed the language gap as an open owner decision and offered a
send-time fallback as "the cheaper alternative". Both are settled: the fallback is built and
live at all six send sites, and the owner has ruled. Left recorded rather than deleted, because
a reader arriving on deployment day with the old text would have submitted three languages that
nobody needs.)*

Two groups, both closed:

1. ✅ **SUBMITTED 2026-09-27 as EDITS** — the rows above, en + fr, 22 edits, owner-approved the
   same day. Plus `customer_booking_balance_due` ("Pay balance", `bpay:<bookingId>:b`), which the
   bookings stream added to the catalogue that day; the generator derives the button set from the
   catalogue, so it went with them. Sent by `npm run whatsapp:templates:submit -- --submit --edit
   --only=<names>` — the submitter gained `--edit` that day; before it, an existing template that
   differed was silently skipped.
2. ✅ **SUBMITTED 2026-09-27 — the three templates that did not exist.**
   `customer_booking_payment_failed`, `customer_order_payment_failed` and
   `customer_booking_balance_received` were created (jovi-mall `5394781`), along with the six
   payout templates that had the same defect (`0a5104e`). ⚠ **They were created WITHOUT quick
   replies**: the payload file holds zero `QUICK_REPLY` buttons. So the two payment-failure rows
   above are now **edits, and each one costs a re-approval** like every other row. The free
   chance, adding buttons at creation, was not used.

✅ **The COD delivery code — the one template the codebase sent and never submitted — is now
`wi_mall_delivery_code`, AUTHENTICATION, APPROVED 2026-09-27** (§ 8). Meta rejected it twice as
UTILITY first. The name-parity guard in `test:customer-notifications` was red on it until then.

⚠ **A template button cannot be hidden at send time.** § 14.4's note on `customer_ticket_resolved`
said the button is "simply not sent for a closed request"; that is not possible — the button is part
of the approved template and is shown regardless, and one sent without a payload returns its LABEL on
tap. So every placeholder-bearing quick reply declares a `templateFallback` (a closed request's
"Not sorted" carries `tkt:new`, opening a new request), asserted at boot.

### 14.6 How to verify stage 2 actually took

⛔ **AN APPROVAL IS NOT EVIDENCE THE SEND WORKS.** Meta reviews the template's *content* at
approval and validates the *component shape* at **send** time, so a template can be `APPROVED`
while every send carrying its new button parameter is refused. **Only a live send per changed
template proves the button parameter is accepted.** Read that before planning the rollout, because
"all approved" is the reassuring measurement that does not answer the question — and on this
platform it would be the second time a green reading stood in for a working path
(see ADR-022: a *successful* n8n execution is not evidence the bot replied).

Then, in order:

1. `npm run whatsapp:templates:submit` (no `--submit`) — prints the difference against the live
   WABA without sending. Templates are WABA-scoped, so this is safe to run at any time.
2. After approval, re-measure rather than trusting the submission: a template can sit `PENDING`,
   and [`whatsapp-templates-submitted`] records that reading a *category* off a pending row is
   meaningless.
3. The live send from the warning above — one per changed template, and the only step that
   exercises the payload parameter end to end.

## Required env

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Meta Cloud API permanent token |
| `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` | Sender phone number ID |
| `WHATSAPP_API_URL` | Optional; defaults to `https://graph.facebook.com/v26.0` (`meta-cloud.provider.ts`) |
| `VENDOR_APP_URL` | Deep-link base for the vendor URL buttons (must match the URL base configured in each vendor template) |
| `AGENCY_APP_URL` | Deep-link base for agency notification buttons (agency templates) |
| `AGENT_APP_URL` | Deep-link base for agent notification buttons (agent templates) |
| `STOREFRONT_URL` | Deep-link base for **customer** notification buttons (customer templates). ⚠ Not `VENDOR_APP_URL`. This row was missing until 2026-09-27, and it is the one the customer templates need |

⚠ **For `npm run whatsapp:templates` (the generator), all four `*_URL` variables are REQUIRED and
must be the PRODUCTION hosts.** Approval bakes the host into the template permanently. The generator
refuses an unset, non-https or localhost value before it writes anything. Each one can be
overridden per run with `--base-<audience>=https://…`. ⚠ **The generator does not load `.env`**:
set the variables in the shell. The repository's development values are `http://` addresses and
would be refused. There is **no host allowlist in code**, so the hosts in the committed JSON record
the last run's environment, not a rule.

## 2026-10-02 — COD limits + delivery-fee proposals: 21 templates SUBMITTED, PENDING Meta review

✅ **Submitted to Meta on 2026-10-02 (`en` + `fr`, 42 submissions); every one is PENDING review.**
This heading read "GENERATED, NOT SUBMITTED" until the submission later the same day. Generated
into `whatsapp-template-payloads.json` (`npm run whatsapp:templates`, 106 → **127** names, 212 →
**254** submissions).

⚠ **How it was submitted, because the one-liner below does not work as written:**
`scripts/submit-whatsapp-templates.ts` reads `WHATSAPP_WABA_ID` and `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`
(`:58`; refuses at `:201` when either is empty) and does **not** load `.env` itself — and the
repository's `.env` names the account `WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID`, not `WHATSAPP_WABA_ID`. The
working form is `WHATSAPP_WABA_ID=<waba> npx ts-node -r dotenv/config
scripts/submit-whatsapp-templates.ts --submit`. ⛔ The script now hard-refuses
`wi_mall_phone_verification_utility` (`NEVER_SUBMIT`, `:79`), which Meta REJECTED on content —
pinned by `test:customer-notifications`.

The paragraph below is the pre-submission text, kept for the record: the 21 had been generated
and **nothing had yet been sent to Meta**. Until they are submitted and APPROVED, these situations deliver on
in-app, push, email, Telegram and **in-window** WhatsApp only; an out-of-window WhatsApp send
fails exactly as every new situation's does on day one. Submit with
`npm run whatsapp:templates:submit -- --submit` (idempotent — it sends only the difference).

The regeneration was checked against the previous file: **all 212 existing submissions are
byte-identical** (no edits would be sent). That includes `agent_shipment_offer_received`, whose
base copy gained an optional `{{forcedLine}}` — its WhatsApp copy is pinned to the old body
through `whatsapp.text`, because the approved template is frozen.

Button hosts baked in: `vendor.wi-mall.com`, `agency.wi-mall.com`, `agent.wi-mall.com` (same as
every existing template — a different host means a different template name).

| Template name | Audience | Situation | Button path |
|---|---|---|---|
| `vendor_shipment_cod_limit_held` | vendor | `shipment.cod_limit_held` | `orders/{{orderId}}` |
| `vendor_delivery_fee_proposal_received` | vendor | `delivery_fee_proposal.received` | `orders/{{orderId}}` |

⚠ **Read before submitting.** Four bodies carry a handler-composed, localised clause as one
parameter (`{{limitReason}}`, `{{termsLine}}`, `{{reasonLine}}`), the same technique as
`vendor_booking_created`'s `{{actionLine}}`. Several bodies open or close on a parameter and were
padded by the generator (its "lead"/"tail" report) — read each once to confirm it still scans.
Meta may re-categorise UTILITY → MARKETING on review; only an APPROVED row states a verdict.
