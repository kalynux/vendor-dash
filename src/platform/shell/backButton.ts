/**
 * The Android hardware back button (CAPACITOR-PLAN.md → P3.1).
 *
 * Back is not a nicety on Android; it is how people leave things. Today, with
 * no listener registered, a press closes Wi-Vendor from any screen — mid-form,
 * mid-wizard, with an open sheet — which reads as a broken app rather than as a
 * missing feature.
 *
 * Capacitor's default (walk the WebView's history) is close enough to right that
 * its absence is the more common bug, but the moment a `backButton` listener
 * exists that default is switched off entirely and JS owns every press. So this
 * handler has to answer all three cases, in this order:
 *
 *   1. **A dialog, sheet or menu is open** → close it. Radix dismisses on
 *      Escape, and Escape is a *keyboard* event that a hardware button never
 *      produces, so without this a back press navigates the page out from
 *      underneath an open sheet — which stays on screen, over a different route.
 *   2. **There is somewhere to go back to** → go there.
 *   3. **We are at the root of the stack** → confirm, then exit. A single press
 *      that quits an app with an unsaved product draft in it is the reason
 *      people learn not to trust the back button.
 *
 * iOS has no hardware back button and never fires this event; the whole module
 * is inert there and on the web.

 * ⚠ **The selector is the whole risk here.** Radix marks open content with
 * `data-state="open"` — but so do Accordion, Collapsible and Tabs *triggers*,
 * and this app leans on all three heavily (Inventory, Settings, Account, the
 * product wizard). Matching `[data-state="open"]` alone would mean one expanded
 * section swallows every back press and the button silently stops working.
 *
 * Hence the qualifiers, which only a modal layer carries:
 *  - `role="dialog"` covers `Dialog` and `Sheet` (our `Sheet` is Radix Dialog
 *    with a side variant), so `ResponsiveModal`, `FilterSheet`,
 *    `MobileOrderDetailSheet`, `MobileMoreDrawer`, `ShareProductDialog`,
 *    `MediaPicker`, `ChannelSetupDialog` and the quick-actions sheet all match.
 *  - `role="alertdialog"` covers every `AlertDialog` confirmation.
 *  - `[data-radix-popper-content-wrapper]` catches the floating family (select,
 *    dropdown, popover, combobox, `InfoHint`) whose content is a child of the
 *    wrapper rather than the element carrying the role.
 *  - `[data-vaul-drawer]` is future-proofing: `components/ui/drawer.tsx` is in
 *    the tree but currently has no importers. ⚠ Note the `data-` prefix — vaul
 *    1.x renamed the attribute, and the un-prefixed `[vaul-drawer]` selector
 *    that agency-dash carries matches nothing in this app's vaul version.
