/**
 * Native token storage — Keychain on iOS, Keystore-backed encrypted storage on
 * Android (CAPACITOR-PLAN.md → P2.4).
 *
 * This is the Phase 1 {@link TokenStore} interface with a real implementation
 * behind it. Nothing above `src/platform/` changes: `tokenStore.ts` selects it,
 * `strategy.ts` calls the same three methods it always did.
 *
 * **`@capacitor/preferences` is not acceptable here.** On Android it is plaintext
 * `SharedPreferences`. A 30-day *sliding* refresh token in plaintext on a rooted
 * device is a standing session for whoever finds it.
 *
 * Two behaviours are load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **An in-memory cache sits in front.** `authHeaders()` runs on every single
 *    request; awaiting a Keystore round trip there would put native IPC in the
 *    hot path of the whole app.
 * 2. **A storage failure never fails the caller.** Keystore is genuinely flaky on
 *    a minority of devices — a changed lock screen can invalidate keys. Throwing
 *    from `set()` would turn a successful login into a failed one; instead the
 *    session lives in memory for this launch and is loudly logged.
