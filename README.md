## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ecommerce-dashboard
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Demo Credentials

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Admin | admin@marketplace.com | password |
| Vendor | vendor@example.com | password |
| Staff | staff@example.com | password |

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `dist/` directory.

## API Integration

The dashboard is designed to easily integrate with a backend API. Key integration points:

### Authentication
- Update `useAuthStore` in `src/store/index.ts` to call your auth API
- The store already handles JWT persistence

### Data Fetching
- Each store has a `fetch*` method that currently uses mock data
- Replace these with actual API calls using your preferred HTTP client (axios, fetch, etc.)

### Example API Integration

```typescript
// src/services/api.ts
import axios from 'axios';

export const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});

api.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('auth-storage');
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${JSON.parse(token).state.user.token}`;
  }
  return config;
});
```

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in — that file is the authoritative
list, with a comment on every variable. The two that decide which deployment
this build talks to:

```env
# Local development
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8022/api
VITE_STOREFRONT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

```env
# Production (this dashboard is served at https://vendor.wi-mall.com)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.wi-mall.com/api
VITE_STOREFRONT_BASE_URL=https://wi-mall.com
```

Neither origin is hardcoded anywhere in `src/` — the storefront links a vendor
copies, the preview iframe, and the sign-in redirect are all built from
`VITE_STOREFRONT_BASE_URL`, so getting these two right is the whole of the
per-environment configuration.

## Customization

### Theming

The dashboard uses CSS variables for theming. Update `src/index.css`:

```css
:root {
  --primary: 240 5.9% 10%;
  --primary-foreground: 0 0% 98%;
  /* ... other variables */
}
```

### Adding New Pages

1. Create a new page component in `src/pages/`
2. Add the route in `src/App.tsx`
3. Add navigation item in `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`

### Adding New Stores

1. Create a new store in `src/store/`
2. Export it from `src/store/index.ts`
3. Use it in your components with `useYourStore()`
