# Service Booking — Frontend Implementation Guide

**Verified against the live route dump on 2026-08-24.**

> ### Scope for this repository — **roughly half of this guide is not yours**
>
> This is a **two-app** reading order. Steps 5–7, and the customer half of step 10, belong to
> the **storefront**, not to the vendor dashboard, and the `customer/*` pages they point at
> are **not mirrored in this repository** — they live in the backend repo. Those references
> are printed as plain paths rather than links for that reason.
>
> **The vendor dashboard share is steps 1–4, 8, 9 and 11**, and each has a full page here:
>
> | Step | Page |
> |---|---|
> | 1 · connect calendar | [`vendor/calendar.md`](./vendor/calendar.md) |
> | 2 · create the service product | [`vendor/products.md`](./vendor/products.md) |
> | 3 · availability | [`vendor/availability-rules.md`](./vendor/availability-rules.md) |
> | 4 · activate | [`vendor/products.md`](./vendor/products.md) |
> | 8–11 · manage bookings | [`vendor/bookings.md`](./vendor/bookings.md) |
>
> 🔴 [`vendor/bookings.md`](./vendor/bookings.md) records **F-23** — the vendor booking
> **reschedule** path is unusable as wired. Read that before building step 10.

This is the **reading order** for implementing the full service-product booking feature. Each step names the doc to open and the endpoints to wire, in the order a frontend should build them. Two audiences are involved: the **vendor** app (set up + manage) and the **customer** app (discover + book + pay).

## Phase 1 — Vendor setup (vendor app)

Build these in order; each depends on the previous.

### Step 1 — Connect Google Calendar  → [vendor/calendar.md](./vendor/calendar.md)

- Render the connection panel from `GET /api/vendor/calendar/status`.
- If `connected: false`, show a "Connect Google Calendar" button that navigates the **browser** to `GET /api/integrations/google/connect` (redirect/OAuth — not a `fetch`).
- When the OAuth flow finishes, the backend redirects the browser back to your configured route (`GOOGLE_OAUTH_FRONTEND_REDIRECT_URL`, e.g. `/dashboard/services`) with `?calendar=connected` or `?calendar=error&reason=...`. Read those params on the landing route, then re-fetch `GET /api/vendor/calendar/status` and show `email` + `permissions` + `requiresReauth`.
- **Gate the rest of setup (and customer booking) on `connected: true`.** Booking creation requires a connected calendar; availability does not (it just won't subtract Google busy times).

### Step 2 — Create the service product  → [vendor/products.md](./vendor/products.md#2--post-apivendorproducts)

- `POST /api/vendor/products` with `type: "service"`. Do **not** send `serviceConfig` here.

### Step 3 — Create the service variant (price + `serviceConfig`)  → [vendor/variants.md](./vendor/variants.md)

- `POST /api/vendor/products/:id/variants` with `price` + `serviceConfig`. A service product has **exactly one** variant carrying its config + price.
- `serviceConfig` requires `durationMinutes` and `bookingMode`; optionally `bufferBeforeMinutes`, `bufferAfterMinutes`, and a `peakHours` surcharge. For `bookingMode: "capacity"` (multi-seat slots, e.g. a class), also send `maxBookings` (≥ 1) — see [serviceConfig.bookingMode](./vendor/variants.md#serviceconfig).
- `price` is the **base price per `durationMinutes`** (e.g. `5000` for a 60-min unit). The booking price is prorated by the actual elapsed duration; peak surcharge applies only to the minutes overlapping the peak window.
- Update the scheduling/peak config later via `PATCH /api/vendor/products/:productId/variants/:variantId/service/config`.

### Step 4 — Define availability + activate  → [vendor/availability-rules.md](./vendor/availability-rules.md)

- Create rules (`POST /api/vendor/products/:id/availability-rules`) — they start as drafts (`isActive: false`). Send an **array** of rules to define the whole week in one request.
- Publish each via `PATCH .../availability-rules/:ruleId/toggle` with `{ "isActive": true }`.
- Activate the product — it needs one active default variant with `serviceConfig.durationMinutes` and `price > 0`. See [Change Product Status](./vendor/products.md#5--status).

## Phase 2 — Customer booking (customer app)  → `customer/bookings.md`

Build the checkout as a short-lived, ordered flow.

### Step 5 — Get available slots

- `GET /api/products/:productId/availability?fromDate&toDate` (public). Render the returned `slots`; keep each `slot.id` opaque.

### Step 6 — Lock, then book

- On slot select: `POST /api/products/:productId/slots/:slotId/lock` → start a 15-min countdown from `expiresAt`.
- On confirm: `POST /api/products/:productId/book` with `{ slotId, metadata }` → returns the `booking` and `price`. The booking's `status` is `confirmed` (`calendar`/`capacity`) or `pending` (`manual`, awaiting vendor acceptance) — see [serviceConfig.bookingMode](./vendor/variants.md#serviceconfig); `paymentStatus` is `unpaid`.
- **Capacity mode**: a slot accepts multiple seats. Availability slots carry `maxBookings`/`spotsRemaining` (render "N spots left"); a full slot returns `available:false`, and booking a full slot returns `409 BOOKING_SLOT_FULL`.
- On abandon: `POST /api/products/:productId/slots/:slotId/unlock` (or let the lock expire).
- Handle `409 BOOKING_SLOT_LOCKED` (someone else holds it) and `409 BOOKING_SLOT_NOT_LOCKED` (lock expired → re-lock).

### Step 7 — Pay and confirm

- `POST /api/bookings/:id/pay` with `{ gateway, channel }`.
- Poll `GET /api/bookings/:id/payment-status` (or rely on payment webhooks) until `paymentStatus: paid`.

## Phase 3 — Vendor booking management (vendor app)  → [vendor/bookings.md](./vendor/bookings.md)

These are independent of each other; build as needed.

- **Step 8** — List + calendar: `GET /api/vendor/bookings`, `GET /api/vendor/bookings/calendar`, `GET /api/vendor/bookings/:id`.
- **Step 9** — Status transitions: `PATCH /api/vendor/bookings/:id/status` (enforces the [state machine](./vendor/bookings.md#patch-apivendorbookingsidstatus)).
- **Step 10** — Reschedule (lock the new slot first) / cancel: `PATCH .../reschedule`, `POST .../cancel`.
- **Step 11** — Mark a cash booking paid: `PATCH .../payment-status`.
- **Step 12** — Complete + settle final price: `POST /api/vendor/bookings/:id/complete` — recomputes the price from the actual elapsed duration (or a flat `fixedPrice`) and returns `finalPrice`, `additionalAmountDue` and `creditDue`. A shortfall is **requested, not charged**: the customer gets a `booking.balance.due` notification and pays it themselves, or you record it as cash.
- **Step 12b** — Take the balance in cash: `POST /api/vendor/bookings/:id/settle-balance`, body `{ amount? }`. See [vendor/bookings.md](./vendor/bookings.md).

---

## Phase 4 — Customer booking management (storefront)  → `customer/bookings.md`

Everything after the purchase. All under `/api/customer/bookings`, customer role, scoped to the caller.

- **Step 13** — "My bookings": `GET /api/customer/bookings` (paged, filterable) and `GET /api/customer/bookings/:id`.
- **Step 14** — Cancel: `POST /api/customer/bookings/:id/cancel`. Gated by the vendor's cancellation policy — handle `422 CANCELLATION_NOT_ALLOWED` and show `error.details.deadline`. A paid booking is refunded, or flagged `refund_pending` with a ticket raised.
- **Step 15** — Reschedule: lock the new slot (Step 6), then `PATCH /api/customer/bookings/:id/reschedule` with `{ newSlotId }`.
- **Step 16** — Pay an outstanding balance: `GET /api/customer/bookings/:id/balance`, then `POST /api/customer/bookings/:id/pay-balance` with `{ gateway, channel }`.
- **Step 17** — The notification inbox: `GET /api/customer/notifications` (+ `/unread-count`, `/preferences`). See `customer/notifications.md`.

> **Customers are now notified.** Booking placed, confirmed, moved, cancelled, completed, paid, refunded, balance due — plus a reminder ~24h before the appointment. Money and cancellations cannot be switched off; progress updates and reminders can.

## Conventions that apply everywhere

- **Auth:** send the `access_token` cookie (browser) or `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The calendar **connect** step must run as a browser navigation so it carries the cookie and can redirect.
- **Success envelope:** `{ "success": true, "data": ... }` (booking management adds `meta` for lists).
- **Error envelope:** `{ "success": false, "requestId": "...", "error": { "code", "message", "statusCode", "details?" } }`. Match on `error.code`. Validation failures use `VALIDATION_ERROR` with `details.fields: [{ path, message, code }]`.
- **Money:** `priceSnapshot` / `price.amount` are in the smallest currency unit (e.g. `5000` = 50.00 XAF).
