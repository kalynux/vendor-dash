/**
 * System bars (CAPACITOR-PLAN.md → P3.3).
 *
 * The app draws edge to edge: on Android 15+ the platform enforces it, and on
 * older versions `@capacitor/status-bar` opts in by default. Either way the
 * status bar and the gesture bar are transparent strips of *icons* laid over the
 * app's own background, so the only thing left to get right is whether those
 * icons are light or dark — and the answer is whatever the app's theme is doing
 * underneath them. Get it wrong and the clock and the battery vanish.
 *
 * **The theme signal is the `.dark` class on `<html>`**, which is deliberately
 * the same one the pre-paint script in `index.html` writes and `StoreProvider`
 * maintains. Observing the DOM rather than subscribing to `useUIStore` means the
 * bars are correct from the very first painted frame — before React mounts — and
 * stay correct through a manual switch, an OS switch while `system` is selected,
 * and any future writer of that class. There is no second source of truth to
 * drift.
 *
 * The `env(safe-area-inset-*)` padding that keeps content out from under those
 * bars is CSS and lives with the components (`MobilePageHeader`, `<main>`,
 * `OnboardingLayout`, `AuthLayout`, `PreviewBanner`); Capacitor 8 injects the
 * values once `viewport-fit=cover` is set, which `index.html` does.
 *
 * ⚠ **Two calls that are deliberately NOT made:** `setOverlaysWebView` and
 * `setBackgroundColor` are documented as unavailable on Android 15+. Overlay is
 * already the default and the status bar is already transparent, so calling
 * either does nothing on a modern device and something inconsistent on an old
 * one.
