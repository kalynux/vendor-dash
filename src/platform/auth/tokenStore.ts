/**
 * Where the bearer (mobile) transport keeps its token pair.
 *
 * The interface is the point: Phase 1 shipped two throwaway implementations so
 * the bearer path could be exercised in a browser, and Phase 2 (P2.4) dropped in
 * the Keychain / Keystore-backed `secureTokenStore` without touching a single
 * caller — only the selection at the bottom of this file changed.
 *
 * On the cookie transport there is nothing to store — the browser holds httpOnly
 * cookies we cannot read and do not need to — so the web store is a no-op rather
 * than a special case at every call site.
 *
 * The shape, the receipt-time stamp and the guards live in `./tokens`; this file
 * re-exports them so every import site can resolve here.
 *
 * See CAPACITOR-PLAN.md (agency-dash) → P1.5, P2.4.
