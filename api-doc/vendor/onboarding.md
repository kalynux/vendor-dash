# Vendor Onboarding API Documentation

**Verified against source on 2026-09-08** — R7 re-checked the five onboarding routes (`modules/vendor/routes.ts:152-180`), the optimistic-`version` 409 (`service/vendor-profile.service.ts:477`), the `409 VENDOR_ONBOARDING_ALREADY_COMPLETED` guard on every step (`:377,456,505`), and the claim that Step 2 re-submission is a **complete no-op** — confirmed at `:466-473`, which returns the unchanged profile whatever the body contains. No defects found.

**Verified against source on 2026-09-06** — every claim on this page was checked against
`jovi-mall/src/`, including the whole inherited defect list that `vendor-dash` carried for it
(DOC-PROGRAM § 24–27). Corrections are marked inline with ⚠ and a source citation.

This documentation provides frontend developers with the complete specifications needed to build the vendor onboarding flow.

The flow uses dedicated `PUT` endpoints for each step — the same pattern used by the [Delivery Agency Onboarding](../agency/onboarding.md). Each step can be re-submitted to update its data without resetting progress.

---

## Overview

The onboarding is a **4-step process** entered after the user adds the "vendor" role to their account:

| # | Step | Endpoint | Required? |
|---|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Basic Setup | `PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/basic-setup` | Yes |
| 2 | Delivery Linking | `PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/delivery-linking` | No (skippable) |
| 3 | Branding | `PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/branding` | No (skippable) |
| 4 | Policy Setup | `PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/policy-setup` | No (skippable) |

`onboarding_step` values returned in the profile:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `1` | Awaiting Basic Setup |
| `2` | Awaiting Delivery Linking |
| `3` | Awaiting Branding |
| `4` | Awaiting Policy Setup |
| `0` | **Onboarding Complete** → redirect to dashboard |

---

## 1. Check Onboarding Status

Call this on every login to determine which onboarding screen to show.

Two endpoints are available — use the richer one (`/onboarding/status`) for building the step-indicator UI.

### Option A — Rich status (recommended)

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/vendor/onboarding/status`
- **Auth**: Yes (Vendor role)

#### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "currentStep": 1,
    "currentStepLabel": "Basic Setup",
    "isComplete": false,
    "progressPercent": 0,
    "completedFields": [],
    "missingFields": ["country", "payout_details"],
    "steps": [
      { "step": 1, "label": "Basic Setup",                 "status": "current",   "required": true  },
      { "step": 2, "label": "Delivery Linking (Optional)", "status": "pending",   "required": false },
      { "step": 3, "label": "Branding (Optional)",         "status": "pending",   "required": false },
      { "step": 4, "label": "Policy Setup (Optional)",     "status": "pending",   "required": false }
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "KYC verification is pending. Your account may have limited functionality until verified by admin."
    ]
  }
}
```

> ⚠ **`progressPercent` is derived from the STEP NUMBER alone, never from `completedFields`.**
> `round(((step === 0 ? 4 : step − 1) / 4) × 100)` — `vendor-profile.dto.ts:231-232`. So it is
> `0 · 25 · 50 · 75 · 100` and nothing else, it moves only when a step is submitted, and filling
> in `country` and `payout_details` without submitting Step 1 leaves it at `0`. Do not render it
> as a field-completion meter; the honest field-level signal is `completedFields` /
> `missingFields` beside it.

> ⚠ **`completedFields` and `missingFields` cover FOUR profile fields, not the whole flow.**
> Only `country`, `timezone`, `payout_details` and `default_delivery_agency_id` are ever tested
> (`vendor-profile.dto.ts:234-241`), and only the first and third can appear in `missingFields` —
> so nothing Steps 3 and 4 collect (branding, addresses, policies) is represented in either list.

**`steps[].status` meanings:**

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `"completed"` | Step was already submitted successfully. |
| `"current"` | This is the step the user should complete next. |
| `"pending"` | Step is locked until prior required steps are done. |

### Option B — Simple status

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/vendor/profile/completion-status`
- **Auth**: Yes (Vendor role)

#### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "onboardingStep": 1,
    "isComplete": false,
    "missingFields": ["country", "payout_details"],
    "stepLabel": "Basic Setup"
  }
}
```

**Frontend routing logic:**

```
currentStep === 0  →  /dashboard                 (onboarding complete)
currentStep === 1  →  /onboarding/basic-setup
currentStep === 2  →  /onboarding/delivery-linking
currentStep === 3  →  /onboarding/branding
currentStep === 4  →  /onboarding/policy-setup
```

---

## 2. Submit Onboarding Steps

### Optimistic Concurrency (Optional)

Any `PUT` step endpoint accepts an optional `version` integer field. If supplied, the backend checks that it matches the profile's current `version` before writing. If it doesn't match (another session submitted changes simultaneously), the request fails with `VENDOR_ONBOARDING_CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION (409)`.

**Best practice:** Always pass `version` from the last profile response you received. On success, the response includes the incremented `version` — store it for the next write.

### Re-edit Behaviour

Once a step is marked complete you may re-submit its endpoint to update the data. The backend saves the new values but does **not** reset `onboarding_step`. This means:

- Submitting Step 1 again when you're on Step 2, 3, or 4 → data saved, `onboarding_step` stays unchanged.
- Submitting Step 2 again when you're on Step 3 or 4 → **complete no-op.** Step 2 writes nothing at all (it is a pure step-advance, `vendor-profile.service.ts:466-473`), so the re-edit path returns the current profile unchanged, whatever the body contains — `skip: true` included. No agency id is updated; that happens through the agency-connections flow.
- Submitting Step 3 again when you're on Step 4 → branding/addresses saved, `onboarding_step` stays `4`.
- Submitting Step 4 completes onboarding → `onboarding_step` advances to `0`.

> **Note:** Once onboarding is fully complete (`onboarding_step === 0`), all onboarding step endpoints return `409 VENDOR_ONBOARDING_ALREADY_COMPLETED`. Use the general profile update endpoint (`PATCH /api/vendor/profile`) to make changes instead.

---

### Step 1: Basic Setup (Required)

- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/basic-setup`
- **Auth**: Yes (Vendor role)
- **Prerequisite**: Vendor profile exists (created via add-role flow)

Captures the vendor's country, timezone, and payout method.

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "country": "CM",
  "timezone": "Africa/Douala",
  "payout_details": [
    {
      "method": "mobile_money",
      "mobile_money": {
        "provider": "MTN Mobile Money",
        "phone_number": "+237670000000",
        "account_name": "Tech Solutions Sarl"
      },
      "bank": null
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required? | Validation | Notes |
|-------|------|-----------|------------|-------|
| `country` | `string` | Yes | Exactly 2 chars, ISO-2 country code | Auto-uppercased (e.g. `"CM"`, `"NG"`). **Locks at onboarding completion** — it can still be corrected on step re-edits while onboarding is in progress, but never afterwards (`403 PROFILE_COUNTRY_IMMUTABLE` on the profile PATCH). Correcting it is rejected (`400 ADDRESS_COUNTRY_MISMATCH`) if geocoded business addresses added in Step 3 already resolve in the old country. All business addresses must be located within it. |
| `timezone` | `string` | Yes | Min 1 char, IANA timezone string | E.g. `"Africa/Douala"`, `"Africa/Lagos"`. |
| `payout_details` | `object[]` | Yes | Min 1 entry, Max 3 entries | Ordered array — index 0 is the preferred method. Full reference, including masking and what happens at payout time: **[Payout methods](./payout-methods.md)**. |
| `payout_details[].method` | `string` | Yes | **Today: `"mobile_money"` only** — `"bank"` and `"card"` are 🚧 [switched off](./payout-methods.md#availability) | Determines which sub-object is required. |
| `payout_details[].mobile_money` | `object \| null` | Conditional | Required if `method === "mobile_money"` | See sub-fields below. |
| `payout_details[].bank` | `object \| null` | Conditional | Required if `method === "bank"` | 🚧 Switched off. See sub-fields below. |
| `payout_details[].card` | `object \| null` | Conditional | Required if `method === "card"` | 🚧 Switched off. See sub-fields below. |
| `version` | `number (integer)` | No | Must match profile `version` if provided | Optimistic concurrency guard. |

**`mobile_money` sub-fields:**

| Field | Type | Required? | Validation |
|-------|------|-----------|------------|
| `provider` | `string` | Yes | Min 1 char. E.g. `"MTN Mobile Money"`, `"Orange Money"` |
| `phone_number` | `string` | Yes | **E.164** — leading `+` and country code required (e.g. `+237670000000`). [Contact formats](../README.md#contact-formats-phone--email) |
| `account_name` | `string` | Yes | Min 1 char |

**`bank` sub-fields** — 🚧 **switched off, not configurable right now**
([why](./payout-methods.md#availability)):

| Field | Type | Required? | Validation |
|-------|------|-----------|------------|
| `bank_name` | `string` | Yes | Min 1 char |
| `account_number` | `string` | Yes | Min 1 char |
| `account_name` | `string` | Yes | Min 1 char |
| `country` | `string` | Yes | Min 1 char. ISO country code recommended (e.g. `"CM"`) |

**`card` sub-fields** (Visa / Mastercard / …) — 🚧 **switched off, not configurable right now**
([why](./payout-methods.md#availability)):

> **The API never accepts a card number or CVV** — send them and the request is **rejected**, not
> silently ignored. A card destination is identified by brand + last 4 + holder + expiry. Full
> rationale and the exact refused field names: [Payout methods → card](./payout-methods.md#card).

| Field | Type | Required? | Validation |
|-------|------|-----------|------------|
| `brand` | `string` | Yes | Enum: `visa` · `mastercard` · `amex` · `discover` · `unionpay` · `jcb` · `diners` · `verve` · `other`. Case-insensitive |
| `last4` | `string` | Yes | Exactly 4 digits — the last 4 of the card number |
| `card_holder_name` | `string` | Yes | Min 1 char |
| `expiry_month` | `number` | Yes | Integer 1–12 |
| `expiry_year` | `number` | Yes | 4-digit year. The card must not already be expired |
| `country` | `string` | Yes | Issuing country. ISO-2 recommended (e.g. `"CM"`) |
| `issuing_bank` | `string \| null` | No | Max 100 chars |
| `gateway_provider` | `string \| null` | No | E.g. `"stripe"` — the gateway that issued the token below |
| `gateway_token` | `string \| null` | No | The gateway's handle for this card, if your client tokenized it |

```jsonc
// 🚧 Refused today with 400 on payout_details.n.method — this is the shape for
// when `card` is switched back on.
{
  "method": "card",
  "card": {
    "brand": "visa",
    "last4": "4242",
    "card_holder_name": "JEAN DUPONT",

    "expiry_year": 2029,
    "country": "CM"
  },
  "mobile_money": null,
  "bank": null
}
```

#### Success Response (`200 OK`)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Basic setup completed",
  "data": {
    "profile": { "..." : "full vendor profile object" },
    "completionStatus": {
      "onboardingStep": 2,
      "isComplete": false,
      "missingFields": [],
      "stepLabel": "Delivery Linking (Optional)"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Delivery Linking (Optional / Skippable)

- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/delivery-linking`
- **Auth**: Yes (Vendor role)
- **Prerequisite**: Step 1 completed

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This step no longer selects a default delivery agency directly.** It is now a plain step-advance — calling it just moves onboarding to Step 3. Selecting an agency requires that agency's **consent**: see [Agency Connections](./agency-connections.md) — the vendor searches agencies (`GET /api/vendor/agency-connections/browse`) and sends connection requests (`POST /api/vendor/agency-connections`), independently of this onboarding step (an agency's approval is async and can't block onboarding progress). **The vendor's `default_delivery_agency_id` is set automatically the first time any connection is approved** — no explicit "set default" call needed for the first one. The vendor can change their default afterward via [`PUT /api/vendor/profile/default-delivery-agency`](./profile.md#put-apivendorprofiledefault-delivery-agency), e.g. once they have several active contracts.
>
> This applies equally to service-only vendors — there's nothing to configure here either way, so there is no meaningful difference between "skipping" and "not skipping" anymore.

#### Request Body

```json
{}
```

`skip` is still accepted for backward compatibility with existing frontend calls, but no longer changes behavior:

```json
{
  "skip": true
}
```

#### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required? | Validation | Notes |
|-------|------|-----------|------------|-------|
| `skip` | `boolean` | No | Defaults to `false` | **Deprecated** — accepted but ignored. Kept only so existing clients don't break. |
| `version` | `number (integer)` | No | Must match profile `version` if provided | Optimistic concurrency guard — ⚠ **on the first-time path only**, see below. |

Any other field (e.g. a legacy client still sending `default_delivery_agency_id`) is silently ignored — it is not part of this endpoint's schema anymore and does not cause a validation error. The schema is literally `{ skip }` (`vendor-onboarding.validator.ts:90-93`), and it is a bare `z.object`, so Zod strips unknown keys rather than rejecting them.

> ⚠ **`version` is enforced on this step ASYMMETRICALLY, and Step 3's note does not carry over.**
> First-time completion (you are *on* Step 2) passes it to
> `atomicOnboardingUpdate(vendorId, { onboarding_step }, expectedVersion)` and a stale value is
> `409 VENDOR_ONBOARDING_CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION` (`vendor-profile.service.ts:476-478`). The
> **re-edit no-op** (you are already on Step 3 or 4) returns at `:466-473` **before that call**,
> so a stale `version` is silently accepted and you get a `200`. Do not use a Step 2 re-edit as a
> concurrency probe — it will tell you your `version` is current when it is not.

#### Success Response (`200 OK`)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Delivery linking completed",
  "data": {
    "profile": { "..." : "full vendor profile object" },
    "completionStatus": {
      "onboardingStep": 3,
      "isComplete": false,
      "missingFields": [],
      "stepLabel": "Branding (Optional)"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Step 3: Branding (Optional / Skippable)

- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/branding`
- **Auth**: Yes (Vendor role)
- **Prerequisite**: Step 2 completed or skipped

Captures the vendor's branding (logo, cover image) and business addresses. This step is optional — the vendor can skip it.

> ⚠ **Skipping (or completing) this step does NOT finish onboarding — it advances to Step 4.**
> `completeStep3` sets `onboarding_step = VendorOnboardingStep.POLICY_SETUP` (4) on both paths
> (`vendor-profile.service.ts:548`). Only **Step 4** writes `COMPLETED` (0) — via
> `recalculateOnboardingStep` returning it at `:682`. This page said
> otherwise, and a client that routes to the dashboard on the Step 3 response strands the
> vendor one step short of finishing.

> [!NOTE]
> The `branding` (logo/cover) you submit here is the **business** branding and is stored on the vendor's [Store](./store.md) — its `logo` and `banner`. `business_addresses` stay on the profile. Edit branding later via `PATCH /api/vendor/store`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Branding images are attached files, not raw URLs.** This mirrors product media (see
> [Vendor Product Upload Reference — Media Handling](./product-upload-flow.md#media-handling)):
> upload the logo/cover image first via `POST /api/files/upload` (multipart, field name `files`),
> then submit the returned file `id`s here as `branding.logo_file_id` / `branding.cover_image_file_id`.
> `GET /api/vendor/profile` and every onboarding response return the **populated file** (`id`, `key`,
> `url`, `mimeType`, `size`, `originalName`), not a bare string.

#### Request Body — Providing Data

```json
{
  "branding": {
    "logo_file_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439030",
    "cover_image_file_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439031"
  },

    {
      "label": "Main Office",

      "city": "Douala",
      "state": "Littoral",
      "geo": {
        "formatted_address": "123 Commerce Ave, Akwa, Douala, Cameroun",
        "coordinates": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [9.7043, 4.0483] },
        "provider": "geoapify",
        "provider_place_id": "way:98765432",
        "components": {
          "street": "Commerce Ave",
          "neighbourhood": "Akwa",
          "city": "Douala",
          "region": "Littoral",
          "country": "Cameroon",
          "country_code": "CM",
          "postal_code": null
        },
        "raw_input": "123 Commerce Ave Akwa"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ⚠ **This example sent `"location": null` and no `geo` until 2026-09-06, and a client copying
> it was rejected.** `completeStep3` runs the same geo guard as the profile update
> (`vendor-profile.service.ts:523` → `address-country.helper.ts:57-64`), so a new address
> without `geo` is `400 ADDRESS_GEO_REQUIRED` — exactly what the field reference below says,
> and what the example contradicted.
>
> **Do not send `location` at all.** It is accepted by the validator
> (`vendor-onboarding.validator.ts:35`) but a nullish value is **stripped before write**, and
> deliberately: the array is 2dsphere-indexed, and one entry holding an explicit `null` beside
> one holding a real point fails index-key extraction and makes **every subsequent write to
> that vendor** fail, whatever it touches (`geo-address.types.ts:169-184`). `geo.coordinates`
> is where the point belongs.
>
> `resolved_at` is server-assigned — send the search result plus `raw_input`, nothing more.

#### Request Body — Skipping

```json
{
  "skip": true
}
```

#### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required? | Validation | Notes |
|-------|------|-----------|------------|-------|
| `skip` | `boolean` | No | Defaults to `false` | Set `true` to advance past this step without providing branding or addresses. ⚠ **It does not finalize onboarding** — it advances to Step 4. Only Step 4 completes. |
| `version` | `number (integer)` | No | Must match profile `version` if provided | Optimistic concurrency guard. ⚠ **NOT ignored when `skip: true`** — the skip path still calls `atomicOnboardingUpdate(vendorId, updates, expectedVersion)`, so a stale `version` is a `409 VENDOR_ONBOARDING_CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION` whether you are skipping or not. Omit it if you do not want the guard. |
| `branding` | `object` | No | See sub-fields | ⚠ **Each slot is independent — this is NOT a full replacement.** `applyBrandingToStore` tests `logo_file_id !== undefined` and `cover_image_file_id !== undefined` separately (`vendor-profile.service.ts:96,108`), so **omitting one leaves it alone**. Send `null` to clear a slot. Ignored entirely if `skip: true`. |
| `branding.logo_file_id` | `string \| null` | No | Valid MongoDB ObjectId of a file you uploaded via `POST /api/files/upload` | Vendor logo image. |
| `branding.cover_image_file_id` | `string \| null` | No | Valid MongoDB ObjectId of a file you uploaded via `POST /api/files/upload` | Cover/banner image. |
| `business_addresses` | `object[]` | No | See sub-fields | Vendor's physical locations. **Full replacement** — send the complete desired array, including unchanged entries. Ignored if `skip: true`. |
| `business_addresses[]._id` | `string` | No | Valid MongoDB ObjectId | **Omit when adding a new address** (a fresh id is generated). **Include the `_id` you got back from `GET /api/vendor/profile`** when re-submitting an existing address (even just editing one field) — otherwise it's treated as removing the old one, which is **rejected** (`409 VENDOR_BUSINESS_ADDRESS_IN_USE`) if any physical product's pickup location still points at it. |
| `business_addresses[].label` | `string` | Yes | Min 1, Max 50 chars | E.g. `"Main Office"`, `"Warehouse"`. |
| `business_addresses[].address_line1` | `string` | Yes | Min 1, Max 200 chars | Primary street address. |
| `business_addresses[].address_line2` | `string \| null` | No | Max 200 chars | Secondary address (suite, floor, etc.). |
| `business_addresses[].city` | `string` | Yes | Min 1, Max 100 chars | City name. |
| `business_addresses[].state` | `string \| null` | No | Max 100 chars | State or region. |
| `business_addresses[].location` | `GeoPoint \| null` | No | `{ type: "Point", coordinates: [lng, lat] }` | **Deprecated — do not send it.** `geo` carries the coordinates. A nullish value is accepted by the validator (`vendor-onboarding.validator.ts:35`) and then **stripped**, never stored, because a persisted `null` in this 2dsphere-indexed array bricks every later write to the vendor (`geo-address.types.ts:169-184`). Reads omit the key entirely. |
| `business_addresses[].geo` | `GeoAddress \| null` | **Yes on new/edited entries** | A selected `/api/geo/search` result (see [Geospatial addresses](../geo/README.md)) | **Required on every new or edited entry**, and must resolve **inside the vendor's registered `country`** (Step 1) — else `400 ADDRESS_GEO_REQUIRED` / `400 ADDRESS_COUNTRY_MISMATCH`. Entries echoed back byte-identical to what is stored are grandfathered (legacy plain-text addresses keep working until next touched). |

> **Clearable fields**: the nullable strings above (`branding.*_file_id`, `address_line2`, `state`)
> accept `null` **or `""`** to clear — both are stored and returned as `null`.
> See [Conventions](../README.md#conventions).

> [!NOTE]

> [Vendor Products — Update Product](./products.md#update-product). Because they are physical

### Step 4: Policy Setup (Optional / Skippable)

- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/policy-setup`
- **Auth**: Yes (Vendor role)
- **Prerequisite**: Step 3 completed or skipped

Captures the vendor's return, cancellation, and support policies. All three sub-policies are optional — the vendor may provide any combination, or skip the step entirely.

> **Note:** The `inspector` field on the return policy is **admin-controlled** and is always set to `"admin"`. It is not accepted in vendor requests.

#### Field Reference — Documents

| `documents` | `string[]` | No | Max 2 items, each a valid URL | Supporting document(s) (e.g. a signed PDF addendum) covering additional terms that don't fit `return_policy` / `cancellation_policy` / `support_policy`. Upload via `POST /api/vendor/profile/policy-documents` first, then submit the resulting URL(s) here. Defaults to `[]`. |

#### Uploading policy documents

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/vendor/profile/policy-documents`
- **Auth**: Yes (Vendor role)
- **Content-Type**: `multipart/form-data`, field name `documents` (1-2 files)

This is a **standalone upload route, unrelated to the product/ticket media pipeline** (`POST /api/files/upload`). Files are **PDF only**, max **5MB each**, max **2 per request**. It does not touch `policies` itself — it only stores the file(s) and returns their public URLs, which you then include in the `documents` array on a `PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/policy-setup` or `PATCH /api/vendor/profile` call.

**Request** (multipart form): `documents` = 1 or 2 PDF files.

**Success Response (`201 Created`)**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "urls": [
      "https://cdn.example.com/vendor-policy-documents/terms-addendum.pdf"
    ]
  },
  "message": "Uploaded 1 document(s)"
}
```

**Error Responses**:

| Status | Code | Cause |
|--------|------|-------|
| `400` | `VENDOR_POLICY_DOCUMENT_MISSING` | No file sent under the `documents` field. |
| `400` | `VENDOR_POLICY_DOCUMENT_TYPE_INVALID` | The **claimed** MIME type is not `application/pdf`. A cheap pre-filter, checked before any bytes are read. |
| `400` | `UPLOAD_POLICY_VIOLATION` | The upload pipeline refused it. `details.violations[]` says why — the **sniffed** type is not a PDF (a file merely *named* `.pdf` and *declared* `application/pdf` reaches this one, not the row above), the 5 MB per-file or 10 MB per-request ceiling, or the owner's plan-driven media quota. |
| `400` | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | More than 2 files sent, or an unexpected field name. |
| `413` | `CATALOG_FILE_TOO_LARGE` | A file exceeds 5MB (multer's own ceiling, which fires before the pipeline). |

> ⚠ **This route has TWO type gates and this table used to document only the first.** The
> claimed-type loop in the controller (`vendor-profile.controller.ts:180-187`) answers with
> this endpoint's own code; `FileSniffingProcessor` then re-checks the **actual bytes** inside
> `UploadIntakeService`, and a failure there is `UPLOAD_POLICY_VIOLATION` with a `violations[]`
> array — a different code, a different shape, and the one that actually decides.

#### Success Response (`200 OK`)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Policy setup completed",
  "data": {
    "profile": { "..." : "full vendor profile object" },
    "completionStatus": {
      "onboardingStep": 0,
      "isComplete": true,
      "missingFields": [],
      "stepLabel": "Onboarding Complete"
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Successful Step Response Shape

All `PUT` step submissions return the same response structure:

```typescript
{
  success: true;
  message: string;
  data: {
    profile: GetVendorProfileResponseDto;      // Full updated vendor profile
    completionStatus: VendorCompletionStatusDto; // Current step + missing fields
  };
}
```

Use `data.completionStatus.onboardingStep` to determine which screen to navigate to next:

| `onboardingStep` | Action |
|------------------|--------|
| `0` | Redirect to dashboard — onboarding complete |
| `1` | Show Basic Setup form |
| `2` | Show Delivery Linking form |
| `3` | Show Branding form |
| `4` | Show Policy Setup form |

## 4. Error Handling

### Validation Errors (`400 VALIDATION_ERROR`)

Returned when the request body fails Zod schema validation.

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "requestId": "3f8a1c74-9b2e-4d10-8c55-6a0f2b7e19dd",
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Request validation failed",
    "statusCode": 400,
    "category": "validation",
    "details": {
      "fields": [
        {
          "path": "refund_percentage",
          "message": "refund_percentage is required when refund_type is \"partial\"",
          "code": "custom"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Logic & State Errors

| HTTP | Code | When it occurs | Suggested frontend action |
|------|------|----------------|---------------------------|
| `400` | `VENDOR_ONBOARDING_STEP_INCOMPLETE` | A prerequisite step has not been completed (e.g. submitting Step 3 before Step 1). | Redirect to the earliest incomplete step. |
| `404` | `AUTH_USER_NOT_FOUND` | No vendor profile exists for the authenticated user. | Redirect to the add-role or registration flow. |
| `409` | `VENDOR_ONBOARDING_ALREADY_COMPLETED` | The vendor is fully onboarded; onboarding endpoints are locked. Use the general profile update endpoint instead. | Redirect to dashboard. |
| `409` | `VENDOR_ONBOARDING_CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION` | The `version` you sent does not match the server's current value — another session saved changes in the meantime. | Show a prompt: *"Your profile was modified elsewhere. Please refresh and try again."* Then re-fetch the profile, store the new `version`, and let the user re-submit. |
| `500` | `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` | Unexpected server error. | Show generic error message. |

## 7. Migration Note: Old vs New Endpoint Pattern

> [!WARNING]
> The previous single-endpoint pattern (`PATCH /api/vendor/onboarding/step` with `{ step: N, ...data }`) has been **removed**. All vendor onboarding now uses the per-step `PUT` endpoints documented above. Frontend code referencing the old endpoint must be updated.

**Before (deprecated):**

```json
PATCH /api/vendor/onboarding/step
{ "step": 1, "country": "CM", "timezone": "Africa/Douala", "payout_details": [...] }
```

**After (current):**

```json
PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/basic-setup
{ "country": "CM", "timezone": "Africa/Douala", "payout_details": [...] }
```

No `step` field in the body — the endpoint itself determines the step.
