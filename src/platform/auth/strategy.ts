/**
 * The auth transport: one interface, two implementations, one selection.
 *
 * The backend did not add a marker header — **the route namespace is the
 * switch** (backend api-doc/auth/FRONTEND-CHANGELOG-mobile-auth.md §1.2). A
 * browser client posts to `/auth/login` and rides httpOnly cookies; a native
 * client posts to `/auth/mobile/login` and rides an `Authorization` header.
 * Request bodies and the non-`tokens` half of every response are byte-identical,
 * so the difference really is only these four questions:
 *
 *   what headers · what credentials mode · how to refresh · which paths
 *
 * ── Why this exists at all ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The backend sets `sameSite: 'lax'` on both auth cookies. Today
 * `vendor.wi-mall.com` and `api.wi-mall.com` are the same site, so Lax works.
 * From a Capacitor WebView the origin is `https://vendor.wi-mall.internal` (or
 * `capacitor://…` on iOS), which is a *different site* — a Lax cookie is never
 * sent, and no CORS setting changes that. It is the same JWT with the same
 * lifetime and the same revocation rule; only delivery differs.
 *
 * Everything above this file — `api.ts`, the services, the stores, the screens —
 * asks the strategy and never asks the platform. That is the rule that keeps
 * `if (isNative)` out of the request path.
 *
 * See CAPACITOR-PLAN.md (agency-dash) → P1.2.
