# Vendor Media Storage

**Verified against backend source on 2026-08-24** —
`src/api/controllers/file-management.controller.ts:183-220` (the `storage` object),
`src/core/uploads/upload-config.ts:136-190` (the per-type caps),
`src/api/validators/file-management.validator.ts:14` (the six category keys),
`scripts/seed/seed-pricing-plans.ts:47-51` (the plan limits).
**Verified against source on 2026-09-08** — the whole page this time, not just the plan-quota half:
the `storage` object and its six singular category keys, the per-type upload caps, the video
route's 70 MB × 3, the 80/90/100 alert thresholds and their per-month dedup, and the blocking
behaviour, against `src/api/controllers/file-management.controller.ts:183-225`,
`src/api/validators/file-management.validator.ts:14`,
`src/core/uploads/upload-config.ts:130-195,329-338`, `src/api/routes/file-upload.routes.ts:29-47`,

`modules/plan-quota/`, `read-models/file-detail.resolver.ts:67-77` and
`repositories/mappers/file.mapper.ts:41-59`. One defect fixed: the error line named `UNAUTHORIZED`
and `FORBIDDEN`, neither of which is in the registry.

How product-media storage works for vendors: the per-plan limit, how to read
usage/analytics, how uploads are gated, the storage-alert notifications, and the
automated storage lifecycle (cleanup) that can detach/delete unused media.

## Base Path
```
/api
```
File endpoints live under `/api/files`; the plan endpoint under `/api/vendor`.

## Authentication
All requests require a Bearer token with the **vendor** role:
```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```
Every endpoint is automatically scoped to the authenticated vendor.

---

## 1. Concepts

### What counts toward storage
The storage limit caps the **total bytes of product media** a vendor stores:

- product & variant **images**
- product **videos**
- any **documents / audio / archives** uploaded through the file endpoints

These are all the files uploaded via `POST /api/files/upload` and
`POST /api/files/upload/video` (owner = the vendor).

### What does NOT count
**Digital-product assets are excluded.** A digital product's downloadable asset
has its own fixed cap of **500 MB per asset on every plan** and never counts
against the media storage limit. (Implementation note: digital-asset files are
also vendor-owned, but the usage calculation subtracts them out, so they never
inflate your `usedBytes`.)

### Per-plan limit (`max_storage_bytes`)
| Plan | Media storage limit |
|---|---|
| Starter | **1 GB** |
| Growth | **10 GB** |
| Business | **100 GB** |

The limit is a per-plan field an admin can change at any time, so **always read
the live value** from the API (below) rather than hardcoding. A vendor's limit is
the `max_storage_bytes` of their currently **active** plan.

### Per-file caps (independent of the storage limit)
Even with storage available, each file must satisfy the upload pipeline's
per-file caps:

| Upload route | Per-file cap | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/files/upload` (images/docs/audio) | image (jpeg/png/webp) **10 MB**, gif **5 MB**, pdf **25 MB**, zip **50 MB**, audio **10–25 MB** | hard vendor ceiling of 500 MB/file, but the per-type cap applies first |
| `POST /api/files/upload/video` | **70 MB** per video, **max 3** per request | mp4 / mov / webm |

---

## 2. Reading storage usage & limit

### GET /api/files/storage
**The primary endpoint for a storage widget.** Returns the owner's usage
breakdown, limit and remaining — without listing files.

**Authorization**: vendor (also customer/agent for their own files). Admins get `403`.

**Request Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Success Response** — `200 OK`:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "limitBytes": 10737418240,
    "usedBytes": 2147483648,
    "remainingBytes": 8589934592,
    "byCategory": {
      "image":    { "bytes": 1048576000, "count": 320 },
      "video":    { "bytes": 1090519040, "count": 12 },
      "document": { "bytes": 8388608,    "count": 5 },
      "audio":    { "bytes": 0, "count": 0 },
      "archive":  { "bytes": 0, "count": 0 },
      "other":    { "bytes": 0, "count": 0 }
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `limitBytes` | number | Active plan's `max_storage_bytes` (vendors). `null` for customer/agent. |
| `usedBytes` | number | Total media bytes in use (digital assets excluded). Equals the sum of `byCategory[*].bytes`. |
| `remainingBytes` | number\|null | `max(0, limitBytes − usedBytes)`. `null` when there is no limit. |
| `byCategory` | object | Per-category `bytes` + file `count`. Categories: `image, video, document, audio, archive, other`. |

**Errors**: `401` — `AUTH_MISSING_TOKEN` · `AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED` · `AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID`
(`auth.middleware.ts:126`) · `403 AUTH_FORBIDDEN` for an admin or unsupported role
(`file-management.controller.ts:216-221`).

🔴 **There is no `UNAUTHORIZED` and no `FORBIDDEN` in the registry** — both were named here until
2026-09-08, and a client branching on either branches on a string the backend never sends, so the
user gets the generic fallback message.

**Frontend tips:**
- Render a usage bar from `usedBytes / limitBytes`; show the per-category split from `byCategory`.
- All values are **bytes** — format client-side (e.g. `2.0 GB`).
- Poll/refresh after each successful upload or file delete.

### GET /api/files  (storage embedded in the listing)
The file listing returns the **same `storage` object** under `data.storage`
(alongside `files` and `pagination`), so a media library screen can show usage
without a second call. `storage` is `null` for admins (their listing is global).
See [File Management → GET /api/files](./file-management.md) for the full listing
contract, filters and the `category` query param.

### GET /api/vendor/plan  (limit + used summary)
The plan endpoint includes a compact `storage` summary so the billing screen can
show usage next to the plan:
```json
"storage": { "limitBytes": 10737418240, "usedBytes": 2147483648, "remainingBytes": 8589934592 }
```
For the full plan response see [Billing — GET /api/vendor/plan](./billing.md).

## 3. Uploading media (and the quota gate)

Product media is uploaded through the file endpoints, then attached to a product
/ variant. Two routes:

- `POST /api/files/upload` — `multipart/form-data`, field **`files`** (1–10 files).
- `POST /api/files/upload/video` — `multipart/form-data`, field **`videos`** (1–3 videos, 70 MB each).

On success each returns the created `File` record(s) (`id`, `key`, `mimeType`,
`size`, …) which you then reference when creating/updating a product.

### Quota enforcement
Before storing, the pipeline checks: **current media usage + this upload’s size ≤
plan `max_storage_bytes`**. If it would exceed the limit, the **entire request is
rejected** and nothing is stored.

**Over-quota response** — `400 Bad Request`:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "requestId": "3f8a1c74-9b2e-4d10-8c55-6a0f2b7e19dd",
  "error": {
    "code": "UPLOAD_POLICY_VIOLATION",
    "message": "Upload policy violations found",
    "statusCode": 400,
    "category": "validation",
    "details": {
      "violations": [
        {
          "code": "QUOTA_EXCEEDED",
          "message": "Storage quota exceeded. Maximum: 10.00 GB, Current: 9.80 GB, Requested: 0.30 GB",
          "metadata": {
            "currentTotalSize": 10522669056,
            "newTotalSize": 10844766208,
            "maxStorageBytes": 10737418240,
            "ownerType": "vendor"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**How the frontend should handle it:**
- Detect a `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` entry inside `error.details.violations[]` (the top-level `code` is `UPLOAD_POLICY_VIOLATION`; other violations like `FILE_TOO_LARGE`, `MIME_NOT_ALLOWED`, `VIRUS_DETECTED` can appear the same way).
- Show "Storage full" with the `metadata` numbers, and a CTA to **delete unused media** or **upgrade the plan** (`POST /api/vendor/plans/:planId/purchase`, see [Billing](./billing.md)).
- Proactively: call `GET /api/files/storage` before large uploads and block the picker when `remainingBytes` is too small.

Other upload refusals arrive the **same way** — top-level `UPLOAD_POLICY_VIOLATION`, with the
reason as a per-file `violations[].code`: `FILE_TOO_LARGE` (413, exceeds the per-file/role cap),
`TOO_MANY_FILES` (400), `NO_FILES_UPLOADED` (400), `MIME_NOT_ALLOWED` (400, unsupported type —
`FILE_TYPE_INVALID` no longer exists).

### Freeing space
Delete unreferenced files via `DELETE /api/files/:id` (only allowed when the file
has no live references — detach it from products/variants first; see
[File Management](./file-management.md)). Deleting media reduces `usedBytes`.

---

## 3.1 🔴 Going over the cap by DOWNGRADING — files are blocked, not refused

**New since 2026-08-24** (`src/modules/plan-quota/`). The section above is the *upload* gate: it
refuses new bytes at the door. It has never been able to do anything about a vendor who is
already over the limit, and until this landed, a vendor who downgraded from 100 GB to 1 GB kept
every byte served forever because nothing ever recounted.

Now, on **every** plan change, the backend refills the allowance **from the oldest file** and
**blocks** whatever no longer fits, newest first. Blocking is not deletion:

| | Blocked file |
|---|---|
| the database row | **kept** |
| the bytes in storage | **kept** |
| its contribution to `usedBytes` | **still counted** — it did not free space |
| what a client gets | `url: null` |
| reversible? | yes — an upgrade restores exactly the same files, oldest first |

⚠ **Never present this to the vendor as "your files were deleted."** The word to use is
*hidden* or *locked*, and the fix is *upgrade* or *delete something older*.

### The two dialects — the part that will catch you out

The same condition is reported **two different ways** depending on which endpoint you asked:

| Where | Field | Value when blocked |
|---|---|---|
| Any `FileDetail` — product media, variant media, branding, avatars | **`access`** | `"quota_blocked"`, and **`url: null`** |
| `GET /api/files` and `GET /api/files/:id` (the media library) | **`access` and `quotaBlockedAt`** | `"quota_blocked"` with `url: null`, **plus** an ISO timestamp on `quotaBlockedAt` |

⚠ **Re-measured 2026-09-08: the library is no longer a different dialect.** This section said it
returned the raw `File` with "no `access` key and no `url` key at all", and that the product-editor
check did not work there. Both handlers now map through `withUrlAndAccess`
(`file-management.controller.ts:185` for the list, `:325` for the detail), which spreads the raw
`File` and **adds** `url` and `access` (`file-detail.resolver.ts:114-120`). **One check —
`access === "quota_blocked"` — works everywhere.**

✅ **The caveat that used to sit here — *"that source change is uncommitted working-tree state"* —
is no longer true.** It landed in `141bc5c` (*feat(files): return url and access on all four
`/api/files/*` responses*, 2026-09-08 02:44) and the controller is clean against `HEAD`. **Rely on
`access`**; you do not need to keep `quotaBlockedAt` as a fallback.

⚠ **`quota_blocked` outranks `authorized`.** A blocked file inside a private tree reports
`quota_blocked`, not `authorized` (`file-detail.resolver.ts:67-77`) — so test for it **first**,
or a private blocked file reads as a permissions problem when it is a billing one.

### Digital-product assets are exempt

Files backing a digital product's downloadable asset are **outside** the media cap — they are
metered under their own per-asset cap — so they are never blocked, and a customer's paid download
never breaks because their vendor downgraded. They are also excluded from `usedBytes` on this
page's `GET /api/files/storage` for the same reason.

### Timing

The recount runs within a second of the plan change, with a nightly sweep as the backstop. It is
not on the request path, so **re-fetch after an upgrade** rather than assuming the purchase
response reflects it.

---

## 4. Storage alerts (notifications)

A daily backend sweep checks each vendor's usage against their plan limit and
raises an in-app notification (plus email/telegram if enabled) when usage crosses
a threshold.

- **Thresholds:** **80%, 90%, 100%** of the plan limit.
- Only the **highest crossed** threshold is sent (a vendor at 95% gets one "90%" alert, not two).
- **De-duped per month per band:** staying above a band re-alerts at most once per calendar month; crossing a higher band alerts immediately.
- **Notification type:** `storage.alert` (`aggregateType: "storage"`, `aggregateId` = vendorId).
  - Title: e.g. `Storage 92% full`
  - Message: e.g. `Your media storage is at 92% of your plan limit (9.2 GB of 10.0 GB). Remove unused product media or upgrade your plan to free up space.`
- **Opt-out:** controlled by the `storageAlert` notification preference (default **on**).

Read alerts via `GET /api/vendor/notifications` and toggle the preference via
`PATCH /api/vendor/notification-preferences`. See [Notifications](./notifications.md)
for the full notification + preferences contract. There is **no separate API** to
fetch alerts — they are normal vendor notifications.

---

## 5. Automated storage lifecycle (what can happen to media)

A scheduled backend job ("file-cleanup") keeps storage tidy. There is **no API**
to call here — but the frontend should understand and communicate these behaviors
because they affect a vendor's product media:

| Stage | What happens | Default timing |
|---|---|---|
| **Product-media detach** | Media on a product with **no paid order** for a long time is detached from the product (it stops occupying the product but is not immediately deleted). | after **45 days** of inactivity |
| **Lonely-file delete** | A file with **no remaining references** (detached / never attached) is permanently deleted, freeing its bytes. | after **15 days** lonely |
| **Storage alert** | Threshold notification (section 4). | daily check |

Protections:
- Files backing a **live customer download entitlement** (digital products a
  customer bought) are **never** detached or deleted.
- The activity clock resets whenever the product receives a **paid order**.

> Operational note: the lifecycle ships in **dry-run by default** (it logs what it
> *would* do without deleting) until an operator enables it; timings are
> environment-configurable. Treat the numbers above as defaults, not contractual.

**Frontend guidance:** surface "unused media may be removed after a period of
inactivity" in storage/help UI, and rely on `GET /api/files/storage` /
`GET /api/files` as the source of truth for what currently exists and counts.

## 6. Error reference

| Code | HTTP | Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UPLOAD_POLICY_VIOLATION` | 400 / 413 | upload | **The only top-level upload code.** Inspect `details.violations[]`. |
| `CATALOG_FILE_TOO_LARGE` | 413 | upload | The multer variant only — the stream was aborted mid-parse, so there is no `details`. |
| `CATALOG_FILE_STILL_REFERENCED` | 409 | delete | File is still attached; detach the entities in `details.usage` first. |
| `CATALOG_FILE_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | read/update/delete | Unknown file id. |
| `AUTH_FORBIDDEN` | 403 | `/api/files/storage`, non-owner reads | Role without an owner scope (e.g. admin). |
| `AUTH_MISSING_TOKEN` / `AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED` | 401 | all | Missing/invalid token. |

Per-file `violations[].code` values (inside `UPLOAD_POLICY_VIOLATION`): `NO_FILES_UPLOADED`,
`TOO_MANY_FILES`, `FILE_TOO_LARGE`, `QUOTA_EXCEEDED`, `TOTAL_SIZE_EXCEEDED`, `MIME_NOT_ALLOWED`,
`MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH`, `POLYGLOT_DETECTED`, `UNDETECTABLE_TYPE`, `DUPLICATE_FILE`,
`VIRUS_DETECTED`, `PERMISSION_DENIED`.

All errors use the standard envelope:
```json
{ "success": false, "requestId": "3f8a1c74-…",
  "error": { "code": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "…", "statusCode": 400, "category": "validation",
             "details": { } } }
```
