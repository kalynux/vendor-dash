 * *inline* rendering differs. That is the whole reason this file exists: it
 * keeps the two formatters from drifting apart on spacing, which is the kind of
 * difference nobody notices until a vendor complains that Telegram "adds a blank

/**
 * Format a document so the result fits a hard character budget.
 *
 * The naive version of this — format, then `slice()` the string — is a bug in
 * both channels. Cutting WhatsApp output can drop a closing `*`, and the client
 * then renders the rest of the conversation's message as one bold run; cutting
 * Telegram HTML can drop a `</b>`, and the Bot API rejects the whole send with
 * `400 can't parse entities`.
 *
 * So the budget is applied to the **document**, and the formatted length is
 * measured afterwards. Markers and tags cost characters the document budget did
 * not count, so overflow is fed back as a smaller document budget and retried.
 * A handful of passes converges — the overhead is bounded by a few characters
 * per span — and the loop is capped anyway.
 *
 * The last resort deliberately abandons formatting rather than the limit: plain
 * text has no markers to sever, so a hard cut on it is always well-formed. A
 * message that arrives unformatted is a disappointment; one that arrives
 * truncated mid-marker is a rendering bug in the customer's chat, and one that
 * exceeds 4096 is not delivered at all.
