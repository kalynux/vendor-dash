# Uptime & status widget — an unserved spec

**Re-verified against the live route dump on 2026-08-24: still unserved.** No public status or
uptime route exists. The only health surfaces are the three on [`health.md`](./health.md), and
the operator ones behind `/api/internal/admin/system/*`, which no browser can reach.

**Kept, not deleted.** It is a decision record — "we chose not to build this, and here is why"
— and deleting it would make the next person propose it again. See
[`README.md`](./README.md).

> ## ⚠ This is an unserved frontend spec. No backend implements it, and that is a decision.
>
> Nothing in this document is backed by an endpoint. The three-dot widget below describes what a
> dashboard *should render given a health signal*, and the public health signal it assumes has
> deliberately **not** been built.
>
> The operator-facing equivalent exists and is where this information actually lives:
>
> - `admin/system.md` — dependency health, integration status, queue depth,
>   cache status, worker state, operational metrics. Service-token only, rendered by wi-admin.
> - [`health.md`](./health.md) — `/api/health` (frozen), `/api/health/live`, `/api/health/ready`,
>   and `/metrics`.
>
> **Before implementing any of the below, read `admin/docs/ADR-014-SYSTEM-OPERATIONS.md`.** A
> public, unauthenticated status endpoint was considered in that phase and refused: the useful
> version of this widget needs infrastructure detail (pool saturation, replication lag, cache hit
> rate, job backlog) that is exactly what should not be exposed to an anonymous caller, and the
> non-useful version is three green dots that stay green during an outage. If the product need
> returns, the decision to revisit is *what a coarse public verdict may safely say* — not whether
> to plumb this document's thresholds through to the browser.
>
> Left in place because the colour vocabulary and the user-communication guidance are still the
> right reference for a frontend rendering a status signal from any source.

## Overview

The dashboard displays **three colored dots** representing the health of each system layer. This provides instant visibility into where an issue is occurring.

| Position | Layer | Responsibility |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **Left dot** | Frontend | Browser app, UI rendering, user's device |
| **Middle dot** | Backend API | REST/GraphQL endpoints, authentication, business logic |
| **Right dot** | Infrastructure | Database, cache, external services, CDN, storage |

## Color Legend

### 🟢 Green — Operational

**Meaning:** The component is fully functional with normal performance.

**Frontend (Left dot):**
- JavaScript is executing correctly
- No client-side errors
- Local storage/indexedDB accessible
- Browser is online
- All assets (CSS, JS, images) loaded successfully

**Backend API (Middle dot):**
- All endpoints return HTTP 200-299
- Average response time < 500ms
- Authentication service working
- No 5xx errors in the last 5 minutes
- Rate limits not exceeded

**Infrastructure (Right dot):**
- Database connections healthy
- Cache (Redis/Memcached) operational
- External API integrations responsive
- File storage accessible
- CDN delivering content
- Queue workers processing jobs

**User action required:** None. Continue using the system normally.

---

### 🟡 Yellow — Degraded

**Meaning:** The component is working but with reduced performance or partial availability.

**Frontend (Left dot):**
- UI loads slowly (> 3s)
- Some features work, others don't
- WebSocket connection unstable (reconnecting)

- External API rate limit approaching

**User action required:** Expect slowness. Try again in a few seconds if an action fails. Avoid bulk operations.

---

### 🔴 Red — Down / Offline

**Meaning:** The component is completely unavailable or critically failing.

**Frontend (Left dot):**
- Browser is offline (no internet connection)
- JavaScript crashed (unhandled exception)
- Critical assets (main.js, vendor.js) failed to load
- Application failed to initialize

### 🟠 Copper / Amber — Client-side Issue

**Meaning:** The problem is specific to THIS user's browser/device, not system-wide.

**Frontend (Left dot only — backend and infrastructure remain normal colors):**

| Scenario | Copper Dot Shows For |
|----------|---------------------|
| Outdated cached version | Frontend only |
| Ad blocker active | Frontend only |
| Cookie consent not granted | Frontend only |
| Local storage corrupted | Frontend only |
| Browser extension interfering | Frontend only |
| VPN blocking WebSocket | Frontend only |
| Firewall blocking API domain | Frontend only |

**Backend API (Middle dot):** Remains 🟢 green because other users are unaffected.

**Infrastructure (Right dot):** Remains 🟢 green.

**User action required:** 
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Disable ad blockers temporarily
- Try incognito/private mode
- Check VPN or firewall settings
- Update browser to latest version

**Troubleshooting guide:** Press F12 → Console tab → Look for red errors. Send screenshot to support.

---

### ⚪ Gray — Unknown / Not Checked

**Meaning:** The status cannot be determined. Health check failed or timed out.

**Frontend (Left dot):**
- Initial load not complete
- JavaScript not yet executed
- Browser in prerendering mode

**Backend API (Middle dot):**
- Health endpoint unreachable (network issue)
- Request timeout (> 10 seconds)
- CORS blocked the request
- DNS resolution failed

## Decision Tree for Determining Status

```
Is browser online?
├─ NO  → Frontend = 🔴 Red, API = ⚪ Gray, Infra = ⚪ Gray
└─ YES → Continue

Can JavaScript execute without errors?
├─ NO  → Frontend = 🔴 Red
└─ YES → Continue

Can API health endpoint be reached (< 5s)?
├─ NO  → API = 🔴 Red or ⚪ Gray
└─ YES → Check API response
    ├─ 200-299 & < 500ms → API = 🟢 Green
    ├─ 200-299 & > 500ms → API = 🟡 Yellow
    ├─ 503 with "maintenance" → API = 🔵 Blue
    ├─ 503 with "deploying" → API = 🟣 Purple
    └─ 5xx → API = 🔴 Red

Is database responding?
├─ Healthy → Infra = 🟢 Green
├─ Lag > 5s or pool > 80% → Infra = 🟡 Yellow
├─ Migration running → Infra = 🔵 Blue
└─ Down → Infra = 🔴 Red

Is issue isolated to this browser?
├─ Other users working? → Frontend = 🟠 Copper
└─ All users affected → Keep standard colors
```
