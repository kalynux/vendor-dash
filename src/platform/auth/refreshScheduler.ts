/**
 * Proactive token refresh (CAPACITOR-PLAN.md → P2.5).
 *
 * Access tokens live 900s. Waiting for a 401 to notice means every session shows
 * the user a stalled screen once every fifteen minutes while the retry unwinds.
 * This module refreshes a minute before the deadline instead, so the 401 path in
 * `api.ts` becomes the fallback it was always meant to be.
 *
 * **It also owns the single-flight lock**, which is why {@link refreshSession}
 * lives here rather than in `api.ts`. Two independent locks would mean a resume
 * and a request can each start a refresh; the second lands with a refresh token
 * the first has already rotated away, and the user is signed out for reasons
 * nothing in the logs explains. One lock, both callers. (`api.ts` keeps its own
 * *request* queue — holding the 401'd requests and replaying them — which is a
 * different job and stays where it is.)
 *
 * On the cookie transport the whole timer half is inert: the no-op token store
 * has no expiry to schedule against, so `scheduleNext()` finds no tokens and
 * arms nothing. The web build keeps exactly the reactive behaviour Phase 1
 * shipped, and only the lock is shared — around a call `api.ts` was already
 * making one at a time.
 *
 * ── Where it is started from ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The plan named `authStrategy.captureTokens()` as the single place a new
 * deadline comes into existence. In this codebase it is not, on two counts, so
 * the call sites are `auth.service.ts`'s three capture points instead
 * (D1: divergence needs a reason written down):
 *
 *   1. `bearerAuthStrategy.refresh()` writes to the token store *directly*, not
 *      through `captureTokens` — so `captureTokens` was never the complete set.
 *      That path is covered here instead, by re-arming inside `refreshSession()`.
 *   2. Calling this module from `strategy.ts` would make `strategy → scheduler →
 *      strategy` an import cycle. Phase 1 created `services/http.ts` specifically
 *      to break a cycle of that shape; re-introducing one here would undo it.
 *
 * `auth.service.ts`'s login / register / auth-me, plus the re-arm after every
 * refresh, is exactly the same coverage with no cycle.
