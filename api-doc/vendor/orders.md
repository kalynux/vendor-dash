# Vendor Orders

**Verified against source on 2026-09-08** — R7 re-checked the fourteen routes against the live route dump and every enum against `modules/orders/order.model.ts:38,44,102,292,401`, plus the two list-filter omissions (`disputed`, `returned`) at `modules/vendor/validators/vendor-order.validator.ts:14-15`. No defects found.

**Verified against source on 2026-09-06** — every claim on this page was checked against
`jovi-mall/src/`, including the whole inherited defect list that `vendor-dash` carried for it
(DOC-PROGRAM § 24–26). Corrections are marked inline with ⚠ and a source citation.

## Endpoints

### GET /api/vendor/orders

**Description**: List vendor orders with filters, search, sorting, and pagination.

**Authorization**: Vendor access required.

**Request Headers**:
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Path Parameters**: None

**Query Parameters**:
- `status` (string, optional) - Filter by order status. Enum: `pending`, `processing`, `partially_shipped`, `shipped`, `partially_delivered`, `delivered`, `fulfilled`, `cancelled`. ⚠ **`returned` is NOT in the filter enum** (`vendor-order.validator.ts:14`) even though it is a real order status — asking for it is a `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`, not an empty page. Returned orders can only be found by paging the unfiltered list
- `paymentStatus` (string, optional) - Filter by payment status. Enum: `pending`, `AWAITING_PAYMENT`, `partially_paid`, `paid`, `failed`, `refunded`. ⚠ **`disputed` is NOT in this enum** (`vendor-order.validator.ts:15`) — a `400`. A disputed order is found through `dispute_hold.active` on the row, not by filtering. Note `AWAITING_PAYMENT` really is the odd UPPERCASE one
- `paymentMethod` (string, optional) - Filter by payment method. Enum: `online`, `cash_on_delivery`
- `orderType` (string, optional) - Filter by order type. Enum: `physical`, `digital`
- `customerId` (string, optional) - Scope the list to one customer. Must be a 24-character ObjectId. **This filter exists and works** (`vendor-order.validator.ts:18`); this page used not to list it
- `dateFrom` (string, optional) - Filter orders from date (ISO 8601 format)
- `dateTo` (string, optional) - Filter orders to date (ISO 8601 format)
- `q` (string, optional, max 100 chars) - Search. ⚠ **`order_number` ONLY** — a case-insensitive substring match on that one field (`vendor-order.repository.ts:79-82`). It does **not** search the customer name, the customer email, or item titles, so typing a customer’s name returns nothing rather than their orders. (The customer-facing list is different: it searches order number *and* item titles.)
- `page` (integer, optional, default: 1) - Page number (1-indexed)
- `limit` (integer, optional, default: 20, max: 100) - Items per page
- `sortBy` (string, optional, default: `created_at`) - Sort field. Enum: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `total_amount`
- `sortOrder` (string, optional, default: `desc`) - Sort order. Enum: `asc`, `desc`

**Request Body**: None

> **Notes:**
> - `customer.orderCount` and `customer.totalSpent` reflect only orders with **this vendor** (not lifetime totals across all vendors).
> - `customer.*` fields are `null` if the customer profile cannot be resolved.
> - `shippingAddress` is the **order's own checkout snapshot**, not the customer's saved address. `_resolveShippingAddress` (`vendor-order.service.ts:370-382`) reads `order.delivery_address` — the geocoded drop-off frozen onto the order at checkout — and flattens it to `street`/`city`/`state`/`country` **while also returning the whole `geo` object alongside them**. The customer's default saved address is only the **fallback**, used when the order carries no `delivery_address`; `null` only when both are absent. ⚠ **This line said the opposite until 2026-09-06** — it named the saved address as the source and never mentioned `geo` at all. The distinction matters: a customer who edits their profile does **not** change where a past order was shipped.
>   - ⚠ **`geo.coordinates` is GeoJSON: `{ "type": "Point", "coordinates": [longitude, latitude] }` — LONGITUDE FIRST** (`IGeoPoint`, `core/types/geo.types.ts:88`). It is not `{ lat, lng }`. Reading it positionally in the wrong order puts Douala in the Gulf of Guinea.
>   - `geo.provider` is one of `nominatim`, `google`, `mapbox`, `here`, `geoapify`, `locationiq` (`GEO_PROVIDERS`). ⚠ **Never `chain`** — a deployment may run the chained provider, but a stored row records the *service* that actually resolved it, because that is what makes `provider_place_id` resolvable later.
>   - `geo.components` carries **seven** keys — `street`, `neighbourhood`, `city`, `region`, `country`, `country_code`, `postal_code` — each independently nullable. The flattened `state` above is `components.region`, and `country` is `components.country_code` falling back to `components.country`, so the flat pair and the `geo` block can legitimately disagree in spelling.
> - `items[].delivery` is the authoritative per-item delivery info — an order can be split across several agencies (one per item). It is `null` for digital items, and `delivery.agent` is `null` until an agent is assigned to the item's shipment.
> - `deliveries` is an order-level overview with one entry per agency/shipment handling the order (de-duplicated by `shipmentId`). It is `null` for digital orders. Use `items[].delivery` when you need to know which agency carries a specific item.
> - **Verified badges (added 2026-09-27).** `agencyVerified` (on `items[].delivery`, `deliveries[]` and `deliveryTimeline[]`) is `true` when admin has verified the agency's business documents — `kyc_details.legit_verified`, never the deprecated top-level mirror. `agent.verified` is `true` when the agent's identity check passed — `kyc.status === 'verified'`, the same test `AgentGateService` applies; only that status is read, never the rest of `kyc`. Both are always booleans (`false` when unknown), so a client can render the badge on `=== true` without a null check.
> - **`deliveryFeeProposals` (added 2026-10-02)** — every delivery-fee proposal an agency (or its agent) made on this order's shipments, newest first; `[]` for digital orders. A `pending` one carries `availableActions: ["approve","reject"]` and **blocks that shipment's pickup until you answer**. Shape, rules and the approve/reject endpoints: [delivery-fee-proposals.md](./delivery-fee-proposals.md).
> - `deliveryTimeline` merges every shipment's status history for this order, labeled by agency and sorted chronologically (see the example above). Each entry is `{ shipmentId, agencyId, agencyName, agencyVerified, status, changedAt, changedByRole }` — the **same shape** as `orderTimeline` on [`GET /api/agency/shipments/:id`](../agency/shipments.md#detail). It is unrelated to the generic audit trail returned by `GET /api/vendor/orders/:id/timeline` below — that endpoint returns `eventType`/`oldValue`/`newValue` events, not shipment status history. Empty for digital orders.
> - `deliveryStatus` reflects the per-item delivery status: `pending`, `assigned`, **`handing_over`**, `picked_up`, `in_transit`, `agent_delivered`, `delivered`, `failed`, `returned`, `rejected`, or `pending_agency_reassignment` — **eleven values**, the schema enum at `order.model.ts:253`. ⚠ **`handing_over` was missing from this list until 2026-09-06.** It is the post-pickup reassignment state: the shipment has left one agent and no replacement has accepted it yet, so an item can sit here with nobody carrying it. Treat it as in-flight-but-unassigned rather than as a delivery step.
> - `delivery.rejection` is `null` unless this item's shipment was **declined**. When set it is `{ reason, note, rejectedAt }` — `reason` is one of `out_of_coverage_area`, `capacity_exceeded`, `invalid_address`, `vendor_item_not_ready`, **`platform_intervention`** or `other` (**six**, `SHIPMENT_REJECTION_REASONS` in `shipment.model.ts:67`); `note` is the free-text explanation (always present when `reason` is `other`, otherwise may be `null`). Use it to decide how to reroute; a `shipment.rejected` notification also fires (see [Notifications](./notifications.md)).
>   ⚠ **`platform_intervention` is NOT an agency decision and this line used to imply it was** — it is the *administrator's* reason, deliberately kept disjoint from every agency-driven one so a later reader can tell *"the agency could not carry this"* from *"the platform pulled it"* (`shipment.model.ts:61-65`, the same argument ADR-008 makes for `platform_oversight`). Do not show it to a vendor as the agency's doing, and do not fold it into `other`.
> - `trackingNumber` is that item's shipment's tracking number — `ACR-YYMMDD-HHMMSS-XXXXX`, where `ACR` is the delivery agency's acronym and the two number groups are the UTC date and time the shipment was created. It is **generated by the platform** when the shipment is created (nobody types it, nobody can change it), so it is present from the moment the order exists — including before dispatch. It may be `null` only on shipments created before generation existed.
> - ⚠ `freeDelivery` was **removed** from each item on 2026-10-03 (ADR-A11): the product flag it snapshotted no longer exists. Free delivery is your shop's delivery terms — [profile.md](./profile.md#delivery-terms-2026-10-03-adr-a10).
> - **Delivery money (2026-10-04, [ADR-A11](../../docs/ADR-A11-CUSTOMER-PAID-DELIVERY.md)).**
>   `shipping` (list) and `priceBreakdown.shipping` (detail) are now **real**: what the CUSTOMER
>   paid for delivery on this order (`price_breakdown.delivery`), `0` when your
>   [delivery terms](./profile.md#delivery-terms-2026-10-03-adr-a11) made it free for them; `total =
>   subtotal + shipping`. It is **not** your cost. What comes out of YOUR net is
>   `priceBreakdown.vendorBorneDelivery` — Σ of `deliveries[].deliveryFee.vendorBorne` (the whole
>   agency fee on a free-delivery order, `0` when the customer paid, unless an approved fee change
>   raised the fee above what the customer paid). `null` on a digital order or while no shipment has
>   a priced fee. Per shipment, `deliveries[].deliveryFee` (also on each `items[].delivery`) is
>   `{ payer, fee, customerPaid, vendorBorne }` — `fee` is what the agency is paid (the approved
>   override, else the posted price snapshotted at checkout). `deliveryPayer` / `deliveryPayerReason`
>   say who paid and why (`shop_always` · `shop_threshold_met` · `shop_never` · `threshold_not_met` ·
>   `cap_fallback` — a free-delivery order too small to carry its fee falls back to customer-paid
>   instead of being refused). Your commission is always on the items only.

**Error Responses**:

### PATCH /api/vendor/orders/:id/status

**Description**: Update the fulfillment status of an order. Enforces state machine transitions.

> **`shipped` / `partially_shipped` / `partially_delivered` / `delivered` are no longer
> vendor-settable.** They are computed automatically from the order's shipments (one per delivery
> agency) as agencies report pickup/transit/delivery and customers confirm each shipment — see
> "Fulfillment lifecycle" below. The complete vendor-triggerable map is **three rows** —
> `pending → {processing, cancelled}`, `processing → {cancelled}` and **`fulfilled → {cancelled}`**
> (`FULFILLMENT_STATE_MACHINE`, `vendor-order.service.ts:45-55`). ⚠ **This page said the map was
> `pending → processing → cancelled`, which omits the third row**: a `fulfilled` order — a
> completed service or a delivered digital product — *can* still be cancelled by its vendor.

> ⚠ **Cancelling a PAID order (2026-10-05).** Moving an order whose `paymentStatus` is `paid` to
> `cancelled` still succeeds and still does **not** refund the customer automatically. It now also
> **pauses the vendor's earnings** for that order and opens a **high-priority refund ticket** for the
> platform team, who refund the customer (the earnings are then reversed) or resume the earnings.
> Since the refund flow (D-4) it also opens a **refund request awaiting approval** for the full
> amount, linked to that ticket — so while it is open, `refund-eligibility` answers
> `REFUND_ALREADY_OPEN` and a vendor refund of the same order is refused (409).
> Show a confirmation before sending it. The bulk endpoint below does the same per order. See
> [FRONTEND-CHANGELOG-earnings-hold-and-pauses.md](./FRONTEND-CHANGELOG-earnings-hold-and-pauses.md).

**Success Response**:

Status: `200 OK`

Body:

The response is the full updated order details object (same shape as `GET /api/vendor/orders/:id`).

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { "...same as GET /api/vendor/orders/:id data..." },
  "message": "Order status updated to 'processing'"
}
```

**Error Responses**:
- `404` – `ORDER_NOT_FOUND` – Order not found or does not belong to vendor
- `400` – `VALIDATION_ERROR` – Invalid status value
- `400` – `ORDER_INVALID_TRANSITION` – The current status has legal next states, but the one you asked for is not among them (e.g. `pending → delivered`). `details` carries `{ from, to, allowed }` — the legal next states, so a client can re-render the picker rather than guess
- `422` – `ORDER_TERMINAL_STATE` – The current status has **no** legal next state. `details` carries `{ status }`. ⚠ **This check runs FIRST**, so `delivered → processing` is this `422` and never the `400` above — the example this page used to give for `ORDER_INVALID_TRANSITION` was the one case that cannot produce it. The six terminal statuses are `partially_shipped`, `shipped`, `partially_delivered`, `delivered`, `cancelled`, `returned`
- `422` – `ORDER_PAYMENT_REQUIRED` – `→ processing` on a prepaid order that is not `paid`. `details` carries `{ paymentStatus }`. COD is exempt (cash is collected at handoff)
- `422` – `ORDER_PAYMENT_FAILED_STATE` – the payment is `failed` or `refunded`. `details` carries `{ paymentStatus }`
- ~~`403` – `FORBIDDEN` – Cannot update status (e.g., payment not confirmed)~~ — **this endpoint answers no `403`, and `FORBIDDEN` is not a code in the registry.** An unpaid order is the `422 ORDER_PAYMENT_REQUIRED` above; ownership failure is the `404`
- `423` – `ORDER_DISPUTE_HOLD` – **The order is frozen by an open payment dispute and cannot be advanced until it settles.** `details` includes `{ disputeId, reason }`. See "Payment disputes" below.

### POST /api/vendor/orders/bulk/status

**Description**: Update the fulfillment status of **many orders in one call** (e.g. "cancel selected", "mark selected as processing" from a bulk-select UI). Each order is validated against its own current state **independently** — one ineligible order does not block the rest of the batch. This is the batched counterpart of `PATCH /api/vendor/orders/:id/status` above and enforces the exact same rules per order (state machine, payment coupling, dispute hold).

**Authorization**: Vendor access required.

**Request Headers**:
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

**Path Parameters**: None

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "orderIds": ["507f1f77bcf86cd799439011", "507f1f77bcf86cd799439012"],
  "status": "processing"
}
```
- `orderIds` (string[], required, 1–50 items) — order IDs to update. A repeated ID is processed once per occurrence, independently — if the first occurrence changes the order's state, the second occurrence will evaluate against that new state (typically ending up in `failed` with `ORDER_TERMINAL_STATE` or `ORDER_INVALID_TRANSITION`).
- `status` (string, required) — New status. Enum: `pending`, `processing`, `cancelled` (same vendor-settable subset as the single-order endpoint).

**Success Response**:

Status: `200 OK` — **always 200 for a well-formed request.** Per-order failures are reported in the response body, not as an HTTP error; only a malformed request (empty/oversized `orderIds`, invalid `status`) returns `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`.

Body:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "total": 5,
    "succeeded": ["507f1f77bcf86cd799439011", "507f1f77bcf86cd799439012", "507f1f77bcf86cd799439013"],
    "failed": [
      { "orderId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439014", "code": "ORDER_PAYMENT_REQUIRED", "reason": "order payment required" },
      { "orderId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439015", "code": "ORDER_TERMINAL_STATE", "reason": "order terminal state" }
    ]
  },
  "message": "3 of 5 order(s) updated to 'processing', 2 failed"
}
```

- `succeeded` — order IDs whose status was actually changed.
- `failed` — one entry per order that was rejected, with `code` (a stable machine-readable error code — use this for logic/mapping) and `reason` (a human-readable string; may be generic for some codes, prefer `code` for display logic).

**Possible `failed[].code` values** (identical to the single-order endpoint's error responses):

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `ORDER_NOT_FOUND` | Order doesn't exist or isn't owned by this vendor |
| `ORDER_TERMINAL_STATE` | Order is `partially_shipped`, `shipped`, `partially_delivered`, `delivered`, `cancelled` or `returned` — the six statuses with no vendor-triggerable next state. Not `fulfilled` |
| `ORDER_INVALID_TRANSITION` | Requested status isn't reachable from the order's current status |
| `ORDER_PAYMENT_REQUIRED` | Order isn't `paid` yet (blocks moving to `processing`) |
| `ORDER_PAYMENT_FAILED_STATE` | Order's payment is `failed`/`refunded` |
| `ORDER_DISPUTE_HOLD` | Order is frozen by an open payment dispute |

**Error Responses** (request-level, before any order is touched):
- `400` – `VALIDATION_ERROR` – `orderIds` empty/exceeds 50 items, contains an invalid ID, or `status` isn't one of the allowed values

---

<a name="dispatch"></a>
### POST /api/vendor/orders/:id/dispatch

**Description**: The vendor's explicit review/approval step before an order reaches its delivery
agency. A physical order's `Shipment`(s) are created at checkout in status `pending` — they stay
invisible to the agency (`GET /agency/shipments` excludes `pending`) until either:
- the vendor calls **this endpoint** after reviewing the paid order, or
- the vendor has `auto_redirect_orders_to_agency` enabled (see `GET/PUT
  /api/vendor/profile/auto-redirect-orders` in [vendor/profile.md](../vendor/profile.md)), in
  which case dispatch happens automatically on payment success and this endpoint is unnecessary
  (calling it afterward is a harmless no-op).

Advances every `pending` shipment of the order to `assigned` and mirrors that onto the matching
order items. Requires the order to be `paid` and not on dispute hold — **except cash-on-delivery
orders** (`paymentMethod: "cash_on_delivery"`), which are dispatchable while still unpaid
(`AWAITING_PAYMENT`/`partially_paid`): COD fulfils before payment by design. For COD, auto-redirect
fires at **checkout** instead of payment success.

**Authorization**: Vendor access required.

**Path Parameters**:
- `id` (string, required) — Order ID

**Success Response** (`200 OK`):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "...same as GET /api/vendor/orders/:id data...",
    "dispatchedShipments": 2
  },
  "message": "Order dispatched to 2 shipment(s)' delivery agency"
}
```

`dispatchedShipments` is `0` if there was nothing pending (already dispatched, or auto-redirect
already handled it) — the response still succeeds, just with an informational message.

**Error Responses**:
- `404` – `ORDER_NOT_FOUND` – Order not found or does not belong to vendor.
- `400` – `ORDER_WRONG_TYPE` – Order is digital (nothing to dispatch to an agency).
- `422` – `ORDER_PAYMENT_REQUIRED` – Order is not yet paid (online orders only — COD orders dispatch unpaid).
- `423` – `ORDER_DISPUTE_HOLD` – Order is frozen by an open payment dispute.

<a name="bulk-dispatch"></a>
### POST /api/vendor/orders/bulk/dispatch

**Description**: Dispatch **many** reviewed, paid physical orders to their delivery agency/agencies in one call (e.g. "dispatch selected" from a bulk-select UI). Each order goes through the exact same checks as the single-order [`POST /api/vendor/orders/:id/dispatch`](#dispatch) above — orders that aren't dispatchable (unpaid, digital, disputed, not found) are reported as failures without blocking the rest of the batch.

**Authorization**: Vendor access required.

**Request Headers**:
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "orderIds": ["507f1f77bcf86cd799439011", "507f1f77bcf86cd799439012"]
}
```
- `orderIds` (string[], required, 1–50 items) — order IDs to dispatch.

**Success Response**:

Status: `200 OK` — **always 200 for a well-formed request.** Per-order failures are reported in the response body, not as an HTTP error.

Body:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "total": 4,
    "succeeded": [
      { "orderId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011", "dispatchedShipments": 1 },
      { "orderId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439012", "dispatchedShipments": 0 }
    ],
    "failed": [
      { "orderId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439013", "code": "ORDER_PAYMENT_REQUIRED", "reason": "order payment required" },
      { "orderId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439014", "code": "ORDER_WRONG_TYPE", "reason": "order wrong type" }
    ]
  },
  "message": "2 of 4 order(s) dispatched, 2 failed"
}
```

- `succeeded` — one entry per order that was **not rejected**, with `dispatchedShipments` (the number of `pending` shipments moved to `assigned`). `dispatchedShipments: 0` is a legitimate no-op — the order was already dispatched or had nothing pending — and is still reported as a success, matching the single-order endpoint's behavior.
- `failed` — one entry per order that was rejected, with `code` (stable, prefer this for logic/mapping) and `reason` (human-readable, may be generic for some codes).

**Possible `failed[].code` values**:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `ORDER_NOT_FOUND` | Order doesn't exist or isn't owned by this vendor |
| `ORDER_WRONG_TYPE` | Order is digital — nothing to dispatch to an agency |
| `ORDER_PAYMENT_REQUIRED` | Order is not yet `paid` — **this is the "unpaid order can't be dispatched" case** |
| `ORDER_DISPUTE_HOLD` | Order is frozen by an open payment dispute |

**Error Responses** (request-level, before any order is touched):
- `400` – `VALIDATION_ERROR` – `orderIds` empty, exceeds 50 items, or contains an invalid ID

### COD limits on dispatch (2026-10-02)

Handing a **COD** shipment to an agency is now checked against two caps on the cash that agency
holds un-remitted (in-flight COD + collected-not-remitted):

1. **The agency's own limit** — 1 000 000 by default, or an administrator's pin (`kind: "agency_limit"`).
2. **Your COD terms' `maxCashPerAgency`** — measured on *your* orders' cash at that agency
   (`kind: "vendor_terms"`). See `GET/PUT /api/vendor/profile/cod-terms` in [profile.md](./profile.md).

| Path | When a cap would be exceeded |
|---|---|
| **Auto-redirect** (your setting) | The order still goes through; that shipment is **not dispatched**, stays `pending`, and gets a `codLimitHold`. The rest of the order dispatches. A timeline entry says so. |
| `POST /orders/:id/dispatch` | `422 COD_AGENCY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, nothing of the order dispatched — **unless** the body is `{ "force": true }` |
| `POST /orders/bulk/dispatch` | that order lands in `data.failed[]` with `code: "COD_AGENCY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"` and `details`; body `force: true` applies to every order in the batch |
| `PATCH /orders/:id/delivery-agency` | `422 COD_AGENCY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` unless `"force": true` |

`details`: `{ kind, currentExposure, additionalAmount, limit, agencyId, shipmentId, hint }`.
A forced shipment records `codLimitForce`; a successful dispatch clears any `codLimitHold`.

Response additions:

- `GET /orders` rows: `codLimitHeld: boolean` — a shipment of this order is held.
- `GET /orders/:id` → `items[].delivery` (and `deliveries[]`):
  - `codLimitHold: { kind, currentExposure, additionalAmount, limit, evaluatedAt } | null`
  - `codLimitForce: { kind, forcedByUserId, forcedByRole, forcedAt, currentExposure, additionalAmount, limit } | null`

Prepaid orders are never affected. A held shipment is not re-tried automatically — dispatch it
(with `force` if still over) once the agency has remitted cash. You are told about each held
shipment by the `shipment.cod_limit_held` notification (preference `codLimitUpdates`, link
`orders/{orderId}`). ⚠ The timeline entry's description always reads "…the delivery agency is at
its cash-on-delivery limit", **even when the hold was your own `maxCashPerAgency`** — read `kind`
in `metadata.codLimitHeld[]` / `codLimitHold`, not the sentence (`OrderService.maybeDispatchToAgencies`).

### GET /api/vendor/orders/:id/timeline

**Description**: Get the audit trail (timeline) for an order showing all status changes and events.

**Authorization**: Vendor access required.

**Request Headers**:
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Path Parameters**:

**Request Body**: None

**Success Response**:

> [!WARNING]
> **`_id` here is correct and is NOT a typo — do not "fix" it to `id`.** A timeline entry is the

**`eventType` values**:

| Value | Produces `oldValue`/`newValue` | Description |
|-------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `order.created` | — | Order was placed |
| `payment.updated` | — | Payment status changed |
| `fulfillment.updated` | ✅ Previous/new fulfillment status | Fulfillment status changed |
| `delivery.agency_updated` | — | Delivery agency assigned or changed |
| `note.added` | `noteId` populated | Vendor internal note added |
| `entitlement.revoked` | — | Digital entitlement revoked |
| `entitlement.restored` | — | Digital entitlement restored |
| `order.completed` | — | Customer confirmed delivery, or it was auto-confirmed |
| `system.action` | — | Automated system event |

> **Nine values, and this table is the whole set** — it is `TimelineEventType` in
> `order-timeline.model.ts:22`, mirrored by the schema's own `enum`, so anything else is
> rejected at write time. ⚠ **`order.completed` was missing from this table until 2026-09-06.**
> Note also that `order.cancelled` is **not** one of them: a cancellation writes a
> `fulfillment.updated` row with `metadata.newStatus = 'cancelled'` and publishes
> `order.cancelled` on the **event bus**, which is a different channel this endpoint never
> returns.

> ⚠ **`oldValue`, `newValue`, `noteId` and `description` are NOT gated on `eventType`.** All
> four are read straight off the event's `metadata` — `previousStatus`, `newStatus`, `noteId`,
> and `reason ?? messagePreview ?? description` respectively (`vendor-order.service.ts:740-743`)
> — so which of them is populated is a property of **whatever wrote the row**, not of the event
> type. The ✅ column above says where they are populated *today*; it is not a guarantee, and it
> is not enforced anywhere. **Test the field for `null`; do not infer it from `eventType`.**
> (This block previously asserted the opposite — that `oldValue`/`newValue` appear *only* on
> `fulfillment.updated` and `noteId` *only* on `note.added`. Corrected from source 2026-09-06.)
> `actor.id` and `actor.name` are `null` for `system` events.

**Error Responses**:
- `404` – `ORDER_NOT_FOUND` – Order not found or does not belong to vendor
- `400` – `VALIDATION_ERROR` – Invalid query parameters

### POST /api/vendor/orders/:id/notes

**Description**: Add a vendor-internal note to an order. Notes are visible only to the vendor.

**Authorization**: Vendor access required.

**Request Headers**:
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

**Path Parameters**:
- `id` (string, required) - Order ID

**Query Parameters**: None

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "message": "string (required, min 1, max 2000 chars) - Note content"
}
```

**Success Response**:

Status: `200 OK`

Body:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "string",
    "message": "Customer requested gift wrapping",
    "authorId": "string",
    "createdAt": "2026-02-09T23:54:00.000Z"
  },
  "message": "Note added successfully"
}
```

**Error Responses**:
- `404` – `ORDER_NOT_FOUND` – Order not found or does not belong to vendor
- `400` – `VALIDATION_ERROR` – Invalid message (empty or exceeds 2000 characters)

---

### GET /api/vendor/orders/:id/notes

**Description**: Get all vendor-internal notes for an order.

**Authorization**: Vendor access required.

**Request Headers**:
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Path Parameters**:
- `id` (string, required) - Order ID

**Query Parameters**: None

**Request Body**: None

**Success Response**:

Status: `200 OK`

Body:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "message": "Customer requested gift wrapping",
      "authorId": "string",
      "createdAt": "2026-02-09T23:54:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Error Responses**:
- `404` – `ORDER_NOT_FOUND` – Order not found or does not belong to vendor

---

### GET /api/vendor/orders/:id/notes/:noteId

**Description**: Get a single vendor-internal note by its ID. Intended for use when the frontend reads a `note.added` timeline event and wants to display the full note content without re-fetching all notes.

**Authorization**: Vendor access required.

**Request Headers**:
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Path Parameters**:
- `id` (string, required) - Order ID. ⚠ **Never read.** `getNoteById(noteId, vendorId)` resolves the note by its own id and the vendor scope alone (`vendor-order.service.ts:866-871`), so any syntactically valid value here returns the note — including another order’s id. Send the real one anyway; do not rely on the mismatch being caught.
- `noteId` (string, required) - Note ID (found in `noteId` field of `note.added` timeline events)

**Query Parameters**: None

**Request Body**: None

**Success Response**:

Status: `200 OK`

Body:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "string",
    "orderId": "string",
    "message": "Customer requested gift wrapping",
    "authorId": "string",
    "createdAt": "2026-02-09T23:54:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

**Error Responses**:
- `404` – `ORDER_NOT_FOUND` – Note not found or does not belong to this vendor. ⚠ The code really is `ORDER_NOT_FOUND` even though the missing thing is a *note* (`vendor-order.service.ts:870`); there is no `ORDER_NOTE_NOT_FOUND` in the registry

---

### PATCH /api/vendor/orders/:id/delivery-agency

**Description**: Reassign the delivery agency for a **single item** of a physical order.

A physical order can be split across several delivery agencies (one per item),
so reassignment is item-scoped — it moves only the specified item to the new
agency and leaves every other item untouched. Behind the scenes the item is
moved between agency shipments: it joins the destination agency's open shipment
for this order (or a new one is created), and is removed from its previous
shipment (which is deleted if it becomes empty).

**Authorization**: Vendor access required.

**Request Headers**:
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

**Path Parameters**:
- `id` (string, required) - Order ID

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "itemId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439012",
  "deliveryAgencyId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439099"
}
```

- `itemId` (string, required) — the order item (`items[].id`) to reassign.
- `deliveryAgencyId` (string, required) — the destination agency.

**Success Response**:

Status: `200 OK`

Body:

The response is the full updated order details object (same shape as `GET /api/vendor/orders/:id`). The reassigned item's `items[].delivery` now points at the new agency, and the order-level `deliveries[]` overview reflects the new shipment split.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { "...same as GET /api/vendor/orders/:id data..." },
  "message": "Delivery agency updated successfully"
}
```

> **Note:** Requesting the agency the item is already assigned to is a no-op and returns the order unchanged.

**Error Responses**:
- `404` – `ORDER_NOT_FOUND` – Order not found or does not belong to vendor
- `404` – `ORDER_ITEM_NOT_FOUND` – No item with that `itemId` exists on the order
- `404` – `ORDER_DELIVERY_AGENCY_NOT_FOUND` – Destination agency does not exist
- `400` – `ORDER_WRONG_TYPE` – Order is not a physical order
- `422` – `ORDER_TERMINAL_STATE` – Order is already delivered or cancelled
- `422` – `ORDER_ITEM_NOT_REASSIGNABLE` – Item has already been dispatched (picked up / in transit / delivered / returned), or its parcel's COD cash has already been collected
- `422` – `COD_AGENCY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` – COD only; see the COD-limit section above (`"force": true` to override)
- `422` – `DELIVERY_FEE_PROPOSAL_VENDOR_NET_NOT_POSITIVE` / `DELIVERY_FEE_PROPOSAL_ORDER_NOT_PAID` – customer-paid order, whole parcel moving: see [delivery-fee-proposals.md](./delivery-fee-proposals.md)
- `409` – `SHIPMENT_REASSIGNMENT_CONFLICT` – the item moved (or its parcel changed) since you loaded the order — **reload and decide again**; nothing was changed by this request
- `409` – `SHIPMENT_ALREADY_HAS_AGENT` – this is the parcel's **last** item and a delivery agent has already **accepted** that parcel; the agency must reassign or release the agent first (`details: { shipmentId, agentId, hint }`). Moving one item of several off such a parcel is still allowed.

> **All or nothing (since 2026-10-04).** The whole change — the item's move, the old parcel's
> removal, the new parcel, any delivery-fee carry or price-difference request, a pending COD code's
> amount — commits together or not at all. Any error above means **nothing** changed; there is no
> half-moved order to repair. Retrying the same request after a `409` is safe.

### GET /api/vendor/orders/:id/entitlements

**Description**: View digital entitlements for an order. Returns download statistics and customer access information for digital products.

> [!NOTE]
> ⚠ **A non-digital order is a `400`, NOT an empty array.** `getOrderEntitlements` throws
> `400 ORDER_WRONG_TYPE` — *"Entitlements are only available for digital orders"* —

### POST /api/vendor/entitlements/:id/revoke

> [!NOTE]
> Note the base path: `/api/vendor/entitlements/:id/revoke` — the **entitlement ID**, not order ID.

**Description**: Revoke a customer's access to a digital entitlement. Requires a reason for audit purposes.

**Authorization**: Vendor access required.

**Request Headers**:
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

**Path Parameters**:
- `id` (string, required) - Entitlement ID

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "reason": "Customer requested refund"
}
```

- `reason` (**required**, string, **min 10 / max 500 characters**) - Reason for revocation (logged in the order timeline as `entitlement.revoked`). ⚠ A short reason is a `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` — *"Reason must be at least 10 characters"* (`vendor-order.validator.ts:80-84`), so `"refund"` is refused.

**Success Response**:

Status: `200 OK`

Body:

## Notes & Constraints

### Order Status Values

Valid status values and typical flow:

```
pending → processing → partially_shipped → shipped → partially_delivered → delivered
                              ↘ fulfilled
                              ↘ cancelled (vendor: only from pending/processing)
```

| Status | Description | Who sets it |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `pending` | Order received, awaiting vendor action | Vendor |
| `processing` | Vendor is preparing the order | Vendor (also set automatically on payment success) |
| `partially_shipped` | **Physical, multi-agency orders only.** At least one shipment has been picked up by its agency, but not all. | **System** — derived from shipment statuses, see [Fulfillment lifecycle](#fulfillment-lifecycle) |
| `shipped` | Every shipment of the order has been picked up by its agency. | **System** |
| `partially_delivered` | **Physical, multi-agency orders only.** At least one shipment has been customer-confirmed as delivered, but not all. | **System** |
| `delivered` | Every shipment of the order has been customer-confirmed as delivered. Triggers order `completion` (escrow release) automatically. | **System** |
| `fulfilled` | Service completed or digital product delivered | System |
| `cancelled` | Order cancelled by vendor or customer | Vendor/customer — only while `pending`/`processing` |
| `returned` | **Terminal.** Set automatically when a **paid dispute is lost** on an order that had already (partially) shipped/delivered (goods must come back). Vendors cannot set this. |

<a name="fulfillment-lifecycle"></a>
> **Fulfillment lifecycle (physical orders).** An order can be split across several delivery
> agencies — one `Shipment` per agency. `partially_shipped`/`shipped`/`partially_delivered`/
> `delivered` are computed by `OrderFulfillmentAggregationService` after every shipment status
> change and are **never** vendor-settable:
> - `shipped` = every shipment's status is `picked_up` or beyond (`in_transit`, `agent_delivered`,
>   `delivered`). `partially_shipped` = some but not all.
> - `delivered` = every shipment's status is `delivered`, i.e. **customer-confirmed** — an agency
>   marking a shipment `agent_delivered` is not enough on its own; see
>   [agency/shipments.md](../agency/shipments.md) and
>   [customer/orders.md](../customer/orders.md#confirm-shipment).
>   `partially_delivered` = some but not all shipments delivered.
> - See `deliveryTimeline` on `GET /api/vendor/orders/:id` for the merged, per-agency status
>   history behind these aggregates.

### Payment Status Values

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | Payment not yet initiated |
| `AWAITING_PAYMENT` | Awaiting payment confirmation (for COD: awaiting cash handoffs) |
| `partially_paid` | **COD only.** Some of the order's shipments have had their cash collected, others are outstanding (or came back `returned`). |
| `paid` | Payment completed successfully (COD: every shipment's cash collected) |
| `disputed` | **A card payment is under dispute (chargeback). The order is frozen — see "Payment disputes" below.** |
| `failed` | Payment attempt failed (COD: every shipment returned with no cash ever collected) |
| `refunded` | Payment has been refunded (incl. a lost dispute) |

### Cash-on-delivery orders (`paymentMethod: "cash_on_delivery"`)

Every order now carries a `paymentMethod` (`"online"` — the default, prepaid via gateway — or
`"cash_on_delivery"`). COD orders **invert the payment/fulfilment sequence**: they are unpaid at
creation, fulfil first, and get paid per shipment when the delivery agent collects cash against
the customer's delivery code. What changes for the vendor dashboard:

- **Dispatch before payment.** COD orders can be moved to `processing` and dispatched while
  `AWAITING_PAYMENT`. Auto-redirect (if enabled) fires at checkout.
- **Payment progresses with delivery**: `AWAITING_PAYMENT` → `partially_paid` → `paid` as each
  shipment's cash is collected. `payment.received.partial` / `payment.received.full`
  notifications fire on each collection, like online payments.
- **No unpaid auto-cancel.** The daily unpaid-order sweep skips COD orders.
- **Earnings timing differs**: your net for each COD shipment is computed at its cash collection
  (minus platform commission, the agency's delivery fee when YOUR shop pays delivery, AND its COD
  handling fee — always computed on the goods only, never on a customer-paid delivery fee) and held in
  escrow. Release requires the usual hold window **plus** the physical cash reaching the platform
  through the agency's remittance — COD earnings can therefore stay `pending` longer than online
  ones. See [transactions.md](./transactions.md).
- **Refunds (since 2026-10-05):** there is no gateway to refund against, so a COD refund is a
  **refund request awaiting an administrator's approval**: the administrator types the customer's
  number (with a picture of the customer's message giving it), a second administrator approves,
  and the transfer is sent only once the agency's cash for that parcel has reached the platform.
  `POST /api/vendor/orders/:id/refund` answers `status: "awaiting_approval"` for a COD order — it
  no longer reports COD as `REFUND_PAYMENT_NOT_FOUND`. See
  [FRONTEND-CHANGELOG-refund-flow.md](./FRONTEND-CHANGELOG-refund-flow.md).

### State Transition Rules

The system enforces valid state transitions:
- Cannot transition out of a terminal state — and the terminal set is **not** the intuitive one. `FULFILLMENT_STATE_MACHINE` calls a status terminal when its allowed-transitions array is empty, which is `partially_shipped`, `shipped`, `partially_delivered`, `delivered`, `cancelled` and `returned`. ⚠ **`fulfilled` is NOT terminal** (`fulfilled → cancelled` is legal), and the three system-derived shipping statuses **are** — terminal *from the vendor’s perspective*, since only the shipment pipeline advances them
- Cannot mark order as `shipped`/`processing` if payment status is not `paid` — **except COD orders**, which fulfil before payment
- **An order on dispute hold cannot advance at all (see below) — returns `423`.**
- State machine validation is enforced in the service layer

### Payment disputes & order freeze (dashboard changes)

Card payments (Stripe) can be **disputed** by the customer (a chargeback). The
backend now reacts to disputes automatically, and the vendor dashboard must
reflect the frozen state.

**The order object carries a `dispute_hold` field:**
```jsonc
"dispute_hold": {
  "active": true,                 // order is frozen
  "disputed_at": "2026-06-24T10:00:00.000Z",
  "resolved_at": null,            // set when won/lost
  "gateway_dispute_id": "dp_123",
  "reason": "stripe_dispute"
}
```

**Lifecycle the dashboard should render:**
1. **Dispute opened** → `payment_status` becomes `disputed` and `dispute_hold.active = true`.
   The order is **frozen**: any call to `PATCH /api/vendor/orders/:id/status` returns
   **`423 ORDER_DISPUTE_HOLD`**. Disable the status-advance buttons and show a clear
   "Payment under dispute — frozen" banner.
2. **Dispute won** → `payment_status` returns to `paid`, `dispute_hold.active = false`.
   Re-enable the normal fulfilment controls.
3. **Dispute lost** (or full refund) → `payment_status` becomes `refunded`,
   `dispute_hold.active = false`, and `fulfillment_status` becomes `returned`
   (if it had shipped/delivered) or `cancelled` (if not). Vendor earnings for the
   order are reversed. The order is terminal — show it as closed/returned.

**What to change on the dashboard:**
- Handle the new `payment_status: "disputed"` and `fulfillment_status: "returned"` values
  (badges, filters, list columns).
- When `dispute_hold.active` is true, **disable all fulfilment actions** and don't even
  attempt the status PATCH; if you do, handle the `423` gracefully (show the banner, not a generic error).
- Surface the dispute on the order detail view (a "Payment disputed" notice with the date).
- Resolution is automatic from Stripe webhooks; the vendor cannot act on a frozen order.
  (Admins can manually resolve via the admin tools if a Stripe event is missed.)

### Date Filters

Date filters (`dateFrom`, `dateTo`) must use ISO 8601 format:
```
2026-02-09T00:00:00.000Z
```

### Search Query

⚠ **`q` searches the order number and NOTHING ELSE.** The repository builds exactly one
condition — `query.order_number = { $regex: filters.q, $options: 'i' }`
(`vendor-order.repository.ts:79-82`) — a case-insensitive substring match on that single field.
Typing a customer's name or email returns **no rows**, not their orders.

> **This section said "Order number · Customer name · Customer email" until 2026-09-06**, while
> the parameter's own entry under *Query Parameters* above had already been corrected to say
> order-number-only. **The page contradicted itself, and the wrong half was the one a reader
> scrolling to "Search Query" would find.** A correction applied at one site is not a
> correction to the page — grep the whole file for the claim.

### Immutable Fields

The following fields cannot be modified via API:
- `orderNumber`
- `totalAmount`
- `customer` details
- `items` array
- `created_at`

### Vendor-Internal Notes

Notes added via `POST /orders/:id/notes`:
- Are visible only to the vendor (not customer)
- Cannot be edited or deleted after creation
- Are included in administrative order views but not customer views
