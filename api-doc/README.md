# jovi-mall API — Frontend Integration Guide

> **Start here.** This is the index and the shared contract for every jovi-mall HTTP endpoint.
> Read this page once, then jump to the per-feature docs linked below. Live GPS tracking lives in a
> **separate service** (geo-tracker) — see [Live Tracking](#live-tracking-geo-tracker).

---

## Services at a glance

| Service | Stack | Base URL (dev) | Realtime | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **jovi-mall** (this repo) | Express + TypeScript + MongoDB | `http://localhost:8022/api` | ❌ HTTP only | this folder |
| **geo-tracker** | Go + Redis + Postgres | `http://localhost:8080` | ✅ WebSocket | `../../geo-tracker/api-doc/` |

jovi-mall owns all users, orders, shipments, money, and the **tracking authorization policy**.
geo-tracker owns live positions, the tracking WebSocket, and routing. A frontend that shows a live
map talks to **both**: jovi-mall for data, geo-tracker for the live stream.

---

## The response envelope (read this first)

Every jovi-mall endpoint returns one of exactly two shapes.

### Success

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { "...": "the payload — object, array, or null" },
  "meta": { "total": 120, "page": 1, "limit": 20, "pages": 6 },
  "message": "Optional human-readable note"
}
```

- `data` is **always present** on success (object, array, or `null`).
- `meta` appears **only** on paginated/list responses (and may carry extra summary fields).
- `message` is optional.

### Error

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "requestId": "req_abc123",
  "error": {
    "code": "AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS",
    "message": "Invalid credentials",
    "statusCode": 401,
    "details": { "fields": [{ "path": "email", "message": "Required" }] }
  }
}
```

- Branch on `error.code` (stable string), not `error.message` (human copy, may change).
- `details.fields[]` is present for validation (`VALIDATION_ERROR`) failures — map each to its form field.
- `requestId` also appears as the `X-Request-Id` response header; quote it in bug reports.

> **⚠️ Breaking change (2026-07-17):** the whole API now uses this envelope uniformly. A handful of
> endpoints (notably **auth**, WhatsApp/Telegram link status, vendor inventory history/reservations)
> previously returned bare payloads or a `pagination` object; they now return `{ success, data, meta }`.
> See [FRONTEND-READINESS.md](../FRONTEND-READINESS.md) for the exact list. Provider **webhooks**
> (`/webhooks/*`) are the deliberate exception — they answer Stripe/Meta/Telegram, not your frontend,
> and keep their provider-specific bodies.

## Pagination

List endpoints accept these query parameters and return a `meta` block:

| Query param | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `page` | integer ≥ 1 | `1` | 1-indexed |
| `limit` | integer 1–100 | `10` | page size |
| `sort` | string | `-createdAt` | field name; prefix `-` for descending (per-endpoint support varies — see each doc) |

Response `meta`:

```json
{ "total": 120, "page": 1, "limit": 20, "pages": 6 }
```

- `total` = total matching records; `pages` = `ceil(total / limit)`.
- The list itself is in `data` (an array). Some list endpoints add summary fields to `meta`
  (e.g. inventory reservations add `totalReserved`).

---

## Authentication

**Cookie-first, Bearer-fallback JWT.** See [auth/README.md](./auth/README.md) for the full flow.

- **Browser clients**: log in via `POST /api/auth/login`; the server sets `access_token` (15 min) and
  `refresh_token` (30 d) **HttpOnly** cookies. Send `credentials: 'include'` on every request.
  Expired access tokens are **silently refreshed** by the server from the refresh cookie — no client action.
- **Mobile / service clients**: send `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`. Bearer callers **cannot**
  silently refresh — on `401` with an expired token, re-login.
- **Roles**: every account holds one or more of `customer · vendor · agency · agent · admin`. A JWT is
  scoped to **one active role**; switch roles by logging in again with `role`, or add a role via
  `POST /api/auth/add-role`.
- **Current identity**: `GET /api/auth/me` (or `GET /api/auth/auth-me/:role` on app launch to restore + refresh).

### Common auth error codes

| `error.code` | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_MISSING_TOKEN` | 401 | No token and no refresh cookie |
| `AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED` / `AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED` | 401 | Token expired, refresh unavailable/failed |
| `AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID` | 401 | Tampered/invalid signature |
| `AUTH_ROLE_NOT_FOUND` | 403 | Authenticated but wrong role for this endpoint |

---

## Permission matrix

Every route tree is guarded by role. `✅` = full access to that area's endpoints for that role;
`—` = no access (403 / not mounted). "Self" means scoped to the caller's own records.

| Area | Anonymous | Customer | Vendor | Agency | Agent | Admin |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

¹ Agents are paid via the ordinary payout pipeline; the platform is the payer. See the COD docs.
² Both the agency and the assigned agent drive the same state machine by the **same transition
table**, through two endpoints (`PATCH /api/agency/shipments/:id/status`,
`POST /api/agent/shipments/:id/status`) — including `handing_over`, so a replacement agent records
their own pickup after a reassignment. What differs is ownership scoping, the optional failure
reason only the agent may attach, and the recorded `changedByRole`. Concurrent writes are resolved
by a from-status compare-and-set: the loser gets `409 SHIPMENT_STATUS_CONFLICT`. `delivered` is
reachable from neither endpoint (COD: the delivery code; prepaid: the customer's confirmation or the
7-day sweep). See [agent/shipments.md](./agent/shipments.md) and
[agency/shipments.md](./agency/shipments.md).
³ `POST /payments/initiate` and `POST /payments/verify` take no credentials; **`GET
/payments/:transactionId` requires auth and returns only the caller's own transaction** (breaking
change, 2026-07-29 — it used to be open). See [payments/README.md](./payments/README.md).
⁴ Vendors read a *booking's* payment state via `GET /api/bookings/:id/payment-status` for bookings
they own. Vendor/agency/agent **plan and credit purchases are a different surface** and create no
`PaymentTransaction` — see [billing-plans-across-roles.md](./billing-plans-across-roles.md).
⁵ The **only** unauthenticated route tree besides auth, catalog browse and the payment
initiate/verify pair. It reads the plan catalog, the credit packs and the published blog — the same
prices and prose the marketing site publishes — and nothing else. Read-only, no identity, no
owner-scoped data; see [public/README.md](./public/README.md) and
[public/articles.md](./public/articles.md).

---

## Uploads

`POST /api/files/upload` (multipart, field `files`, 1–10 files) and `POST /api/files/upload/video`
(field `videos`) are shared by **all authenticated roles**, with per-role size limits
(customer 100 MB · vendor 500 MB · agent 1 GB · admin 2 GB · video 70 MB). Manage with
`GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/files/:id`, `GET /api/files`, `GET /api/files/storage`. Uploaded files are
referenced elsewhere by their returned `id` (e.g. product images, branding, KYC) — what a file is
*for* is decided at that point, not at upload, so each upload is stored by its own detected media
type (`images/`, `documents/`, `audio/`, `archives/`, `videos/`, `other/`). Full contract:
[uploads/README.md](./uploads/README.md) (role-neutral) and [vendor/file-management.md](./vendor/file-management.md).

---

## Live tracking (geo-tracker)

The live map/GPS stream is a **separate service**. jovi-mall only answers *"which agents may this
viewer track?"* via `GET /api/tracking/visible-agents`; geo-tracker does the streaming.

- Authorization policy & the visible-agents contract: [tracking/live-tracking.md](./tracking/live-tracking.md),
  [tracking/agent-tracking-policy.md](./tracking/agent-tracking-policy.md).
- WebSocket connection, subscribe/heartbeat frames, payloads, reconnect: **geo-tracker**
  `../../geo-tracker/api-doc/tracking-websocket.md`.
- Session reads, routing, ETA, locations: `../../geo-tracker/api-doc/`.

Same JWT signs both services — forward the viewer's access token to geo-tracker.

## Conventions

- **IDs** are MongoDB ObjectIds (24-hex strings).
- **Timestamps** are ISO-8601 UTC strings (`2026-07-17T10:20:30.000Z`).
- **Phone numbers** are **E.164, everywhere** — see [Contact formats](#contact-formats-phone--email).
- **Email addresses** are validated and lowercased — see [Contact formats](#contact-formats-phone--email).
- **Clearing optional fields** (added 2026-07-22): optional string fields in PATCH/POST bodies are
  *clearable* unless a doc says otherwise. Three states: **omit** the key → stored value unchanged;
  send **`null` or `""`** (whitespace-only counts as `""`) → field **cleared**, stored and returned
  as `null`; send a value → it must satisfy the field's constraint (URL, email, length…), and invalid
  non-empty values are rejected with `VALIDATION_ERROR`. Required fields (e.g. store `name`) and
  verified identity fields (vendor `email`/`phone`) are **not** clearable. Numeric/boolean/date
  fields accept `null` where documented but never `""`.
- **Money** is stored in the smallest unit is **not** assumed — amounts are numbers in the account
  currency (default `XAF`); check each endpoint. COD amounts are whole-currency numbers.
- **Soft delete**: most resources are soft-deleted; list endpoints never return deleted records.
- **`Content-Type: application/json`** on every non-multipart POST/PATCH/PUT.

---

## Contact formats (phone & email)

**One rule, every endpoint.** Wherever the API accepts a phone number or an email address — auth,
profiles, store/magazin support contacts, payout destinations, payment channels, agent emergency
contacts, vendor support channels — the same validation applies. There is no endpoint with a looser
rule, and no field where "it's optional" means "it's unchecked".

### Phone numbers — E.164 only

```
+237670000000        ✅
+237 670 00 00 00    ✅  formatting is stripped for you; stored as +237670000000
+1 (555) 010-9999    ✅
670000000            ❌  no country code — VALIDATION_ERROR
00237670000000       ❌  00-prefixed dialling is not E.164 — send the +
+0237670000          ❌  a country code cannot start with 0
+237                 ❌  incomplete
```

- A leading **`+` and country calling code are required**. The server will not guess a country: the
  platform serves several, so a national number has no single correct expansion.
- 7–15 digits total (the E.164 ceiling is 15).
- **Spaces, dashes, dots and parentheses are accepted and stripped.** What is stored and echoed back
  is the canonical form, so send the number however your input mask produces it.
- This validates *format*, not reachability — a well-formed number may still be unassigned.

### Email addresses

```
name@example.com          ✅
  Name@Example.COM        ✅  trimmed and lowercased; stored as name@example.com
o'brien+tag@my-shop.io    ✅
name@example              ❌  no TLD
root@localhost            ❌  bare host
"john doe"@example.com     ❌  legal in the RFC, undeliverable in practice
na..me@example.com        ❌
```

- RFC 5322 dot-atom local part, a real dotted domain with an alphabetic TLD, and the RFC 5321 length
  limits (64 for the local part, 254 for the whole address).
- **Addresses are trimmed and lowercased** before storage and comparison, so `Ada@Example.com` and
  `ada@example.com` are the same account. Log in with either.

### Optional stays optional

Optionality did not change anywhere. A field that was optional is still optional, and a *clearable*
field can still be cleared with `null`/`""` (see **Clearing optional fields** above). The rule is
only ever applied to a value that is actually supplied.

### Errors

Failures use the standard envelope with `error.code = "VALIDATION_ERROR"` (HTTP 400) and name the
offending field in `error.details.fields[]`:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "requestId": "req_abc123",
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Validation failed",
    "statusCode": 400,
    "details": {
      "fields": [
        {
          "path": "phone",
          "message": "Phone number must be in international E.164 format, including the country code (e.g. +237670000000)",
          "code": "custom"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **⚠️ Breaking change:** endpoints that previously accepted a national number (they only checked
> length — `min(6)`/`min(8)`) now require the country code. `POST /api/auth/login` validates its
> `identifier` the same way, so **an account whose stored `login_phone` predates this rule must have
> that number migrated to E.164 before its owner can log in by phone.** Logging in by email is
> unaffected.
