 * other module asks this file instead of sniffing `window`, the user agent, or
 * the URL scheme, so there is exactly one place to change when the shell changes.
 *
 * Phase 2 (P2.3) replaced the Phase 1 stubs with the real runtime, and nothing
 * else in the codebase changed when it did — which was the point of stubbing
 * them. On the web build `Capacitor.getPlatform()` answers `'web'` and
 * `isNative` is `false`, so the browser behaviour Phase 1 shipped is untouched:
 * the web build stays the control group (ground rule 3).
