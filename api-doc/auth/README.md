# Auth API

**Verified against source on 2026-09-08** — the 24-row route table, both refresh error tables,
the two `/auth` rate-limit buckets, the token TTLs and the 90-day cap were re-checked against
`jovi-mall/src/modules/auth/`, `src/api/middlewares/auth.middleware.ts`, `src/core/auth/` and
`src/api/rate-limit/`. First verified 2026-09-06 (DOC-PROGRAM § 24–27). Corrections are marked
inline with ⚠ and a source citation.

## Overview

The auth system handles user registration, login, token management, and account verification. Authentication is **role-based** — every user has one or more roles, and all JWTs are scoped to a **single active role** at a time.

> ### 👤 Customers do not use this page
>
> A customer registers **in the WhatsApp / Telegram bot** and signs in **without a password**.
> Their whole flow — what the storefront must build, and the three things it must *not* — is
> **[customer-auth.md](./customer-auth.md)**. Everything on this page describes `vendor`,
> `agency` and `agent` unless it says otherwise.

### Session Strategy: two delivery modes, one session model

The tokens are the same everywhere — same claims, same lifetimes, same secrets, same
revocation. Only **delivery** differs, and it is chosen by the route namespace, never by a
header:

| Namespace | Delivery | For |
|---|---|---|
| `/auth/*` | two **HttpOnly cookies** | browsers |
| `/auth/browser/*` | the same two cookies | OAuth redirect flows needing a stable login URL |
| `/auth/mobile/*` | a **`tokens` object in the response body** | native / WebView clients that cannot use a cookie |

See [Mobile namespace](#mobile-namespace--bearer-clients) below.

On every successful login or registration **through the cookie namespaces**, the server sets
**two HttpOnly cookies**:

| Cookie | TTL | Purpose |
|--------|-----|---------|
| `access_token` | 15 min | Authenticates requests |
| `refresh_token` | 30 days | Issues new access tokens without re-login |

Both cookies are `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, and `Secure` in production. **On `/auth/*` and
`/auth/browser/*`, tokens are never returned in the response body** — only `/auth/mobile/*`
returns them, and it sets no cookie at all.

The cookie `max-age` and the token's own `exp` are derived from the *same* two constants
(`core/auth/token.issuer.ts`), so a cookie can never outlive or predecease the token inside it.

---

## Response Envelope

> **⚠️ Breaking change (2026-07-17):** auth responses are now wrapped in the platform-standard
> success envelope. Payloads that were previously returned at the top level (`{ user, role, role_entity }`)
> are now nested under `data`.

Every **success** response on this service uses:

```json
{ "success": true, "data": <payload>, "meta": { "...": "pagination or summary" }, "message": "optional note" }
```

- `data` always holds the payload (object, array, or `null`).
- `meta` appears only on paginated/list responses (`{ total, page, limit, pages }`).
- `message` is an optional human-readable note.

Every **error** response uses the mirror shape:

```json
{ "success": false, "requestId": "req_abc", "error": { "code": "AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS", "message": "Invalid credentials", "statusCode": 401, "category": "authentication", "details": {} } }
```

`error.category` is always present — one of nine values. See [errors/README.md](../errors/README.md).

Read `data` for the body, `error.code` for programmatic handling. All examples below show the full envelope.

---

## Frontend Integration

All fetch/axios calls **must** include credentials to send cookies:

```js
// fetch
fetch('/api/auth/me', { credentials: 'include' });

// axios (set globally once)
axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;
```

All POST endpoints require `Content-Type: application/json`.

---

## Roles

**Exactly four roles can be authenticated as on this service**: `customer`, `vendor`, `agency`,
`agent`. All four schemas derive from one list (`AUTHENTICATABLE_ROLES` in `auth.schemas.ts`),
so the same four are accepted by register, login, `auth-me` and `add-role`.

| Role | Has Onboarding? | Signs in with | Notes |
|------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| `customer` | ❌ No | **a bot-issued link or code** — see [customer-auth.md](./customer-auth.md) | `onboarding_step` is always `0` |
| `vendor` | ✅ Yes — 4 steps (`PUT` per step) | a password | Must complete before accessing dashboard |
| `agency` | ✅ Yes — init + 4 steps (`PUT` per step) | a password | Must complete before accessing dashboard |
| `agent` | ✅ Yes — 2 steps (one `PATCH …/step`) | a password | Must complete before accessing dashboard |

A user can hold **multiple roles** and log in under any of them independently.

> ### ⚠ `admin` is NOT a role on this service
>
> It is refused by register, login, `auth-me` **and** `add-role`, all four. Administrator
> identity lives in the separate `wi-admin` database — an administrator holds no `users` row
> here at all and reaches this service through a service token (`requireAdminCaller`), never
> through a session. A legacy `roles: ["admin"]` row may still exist; it cannot be
> authenticated as, and auto-role-resolution filters it out rather than picking it.
>
> The platform-wide permission matrix in [../README.md](../README.md#permission-matrix) still
> lists an Admin column — that is the wi-admin operator, reaching these routes over the
> internal service surface. It is not a session you can mint here.

There is **no** `POST /auth/refresh` or `/auth/verify-code` on this service, and no
`/auth/mobile/logout`; the table above is the complete auth surface — **24 routes**, from
`src/modules/auth/auth.routes.ts` + `routes/browser-auth.routes.ts` +
`routes/mobile-auth.routes.ts` + `modules/messaging-login/messaging-login.routes.ts`
+ `modules/messaging-login/mobile-messaging-login.routes.ts`.

```bash
# the table above, re-measured — run from jovi-mall/

grep -cE '^(GET|POST|PUT|PATCH|DELETE) /api/auth/' ../DOC-PROGRAM/evidence/jovi-routes.txt   # → 24
```

## Password reset

Added 2026-08-14. Before it there was no recovery path at all: `PATCH /api/me/password`
requires the **old** password, and the only other way to change a login identifier is an
admin-only route on the internal service surface — so a forgotten password was a permanent
lockout.

### POST `/auth/forgot-password`

```json
{ "identifier": "jane@example.com" }
```

`identifier` is an email address or an E.164 phone number, normalised exactly as `/auth/login`
normalises it.

**Always answers `200` with the same body**, whether or not the account exists:

```json
{ "success": true, "data": null, "message": "If that account exists, a password reset link has been sent." }
```

> **⚠️ Do not treat any part of this response as a signal about whether an account exists.**
> The uniformity is deliberate: any observable difference — a 404, a different message, a
> suspended-account error — turns this endpoint into an account-enumeration oracle. Feed it a
> list of phone numbers and learn which ones bank here. A suspended account is also answered
> with the same 200 and no email.
>
> A malformed identifier *is* still a `400`. That leaks nothing: it says the **input** is not
> a well-formed address or number, which the caller can see for themselves.

**Delivery is over email *and* WhatsApp** when both identifiers are on file. WhatsApp matters
here: `phone` is the required registration field and `email` is optional, so an email-only
reset would be undeliverable for a large share of this audience.

The link points at `STOREFRONT_URL/reset-password?token=…` — the **storefront**, not this API,
because a reset needs a form for the new password and only the frontend has one. Email
verification now works the same way — see `POST /auth/verify-email`.

The token lives **30 minutes** and is single-use.

### POST `/auth/reset-password`

```json
{ "token": "…64 hex…", "newPassword": "Str0ng!Pass" }
```

`newPassword` must satisfy the shared strength rule: **8+ characters with an uppercase, a
lowercase, a digit and a symbol** — the same `PasswordStrengthSchema`
`PATCH /api/me/password` uses.

> ⚠️ That is deliberately **stricter than `POST /auth/register`**, which still accepts 6
> characters with no complexity rule. The two disagree, and this is the right side of the
> disagreement: raising registration is a breaking change for existing clients and is out of
> scope, but a new password set through a new endpoint has no back-compat debt.

**Success `200`** — `{ "success": true, "data": null, "message": "Your password has been reset…" }`

> **It does not sign you in.** The link arrives by email or WhatsApp, either of which may be
> read on a device that is not the one asking — issuing a session on redemption would hand it
> to whoever opened the message. Sign in with the new password through `/auth/login`.

> **It revokes every other session.** The write stamps `password_changed_at`, and any token
> issued before that instant is refused with `401 AUTH_PASSWORD_CHANGED` on both the access
> and refresh paths. That is the point of a reset after a compromise.

| `error.code` | Status | When |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_RESET_TOKEN_INVALID` | 400 | Token absent, expired, malformed **or already spent** — deliberately one code for all four, so the response cannot confirm whether a token was ever real |
| `AUTH_ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED` | 403 | The account was suspended between the request and the redemption |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 400 | `newPassword` fails the strength rule |

Both endpoints inherit the credential bucket below (20/min/IP).

> **The `/auth/browser/*` trio is a parallel namespace, not a different session model.** It
> exists so OAuth redirect flows have a stable browser login URL; it issues the *same* two JWT
> cookies as `/auth/login`. All three require `Content-Type: application/json`
> (`requireJsonContent`, a CSRF mitigation) and answer `400 VALIDATION_ERROR —
> "Bad Request: Only JSON content is accepted"` otherwise. `POST /auth/browser/login` takes the
> same body as `/auth/login` and returns a **smaller** payload —
> `{ user: { id, email, role } }` only, with no `role_entity`. Use `/auth/login` unless you are
> specifically in an OAuth redirect flow.

### Rate limiting

The `/auth` prefix — **all five routers** — sits behind **two** IP-scoped buckets, chosen per path
and applied before authentication:

| Bucket | Limit | Paths |
|---|---|---|
| **credential** | **20/min/IP** | everything that presents a credential: `login`, `register`, `forgot-password`, `reset-password`, `add-role`, the verification routes, the `browser`/`mobile` login + register twins, **`/auth/email-change/confirm`, and all four magic routes** — `/auth/magic/link`, `/auth/magic/code`, `/auth/mobile/magic/link`, `/auth/mobile/magic/code`. **The default** — anything not in the session row is here, and a route added later inherits it |
| **session** | **300/min/IP** | everything that merely extends a session you already hold. A closed, five-entry **allowlist** (`auth-paths.ts:38-77`): `/auth/me`, `/auth/auth-me` (prefix, covers `/:role`), `/auth/mobile/auth-me`, `/auth/browser/refresh`, `/auth/mobile/refresh` |

> ⚠ **Two corrections here, 2026-09-06.** This said "all **three** routers" — there are **five**
> mounted under `/auth` (`api/index.ts:96, 97, 98, 107, 122`), the two extra being the magic-login
> pair. ✅ **The source comment that said the same thing has since been fixed** — `api/index.ts:73`
> now reads "ALL FIVE" and names all five routers (corrected 2026-09-07). An earlier revision of
> this note called it "the stale half"; that is no longer true.
>
> And the credential list omitted `email-change/confirm` and all four magic routes. The
> **direction** of the split is what makes that safe rather than dangerous: the session list is
> an allowlist, so anything unnamed stays **strict**. But it left the magic routes — which *are*

Exactly one of the two applies per request. The credential number is the strictest in the
service and is a security control, not a backstop; the session number is a backstop, and
Layer A (1200/IP) plus Layer B (600–1200/user) still apply on top of both.

> ⚠ **On an *authenticated* route, `RateLimit: remaining=…` describes Layer B, not the bucket
> above.** Layer B is attached at the tail of `requireAuth`, so it writes its headers last and
> overwrites whatever ran before it. On `GET /auth/me` as a customer you will therefore read
> `RateLimit-Policy: 600;w=60` — the per-*user* ceiling — even though the 300/IP session bucket
> also counted the request. This is not new to the split (Layer A has always been overwritten
> the same way); it is worth knowing because the header you can read is the per-user one, and it
> is usually the one you would want. On an unauthenticated route (`login`, `mobile/refresh`) the
> header is the IP bucket, because Layer B never runs.

## POST `/auth/register`

Creates a new user and a role profile in one step. Sets both auth cookies on success.

**Auth**: Public

### Request Body

```json
{
  "phone": "+2348012345678",
  "password": "secret123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "role": "vendor",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "business_name": "John's Shop",
  "agency_name": "Fast Riders",
  "terms_accepted": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `phone` | string | ✅ | **E.164, with the `+` and country code** (`+2348012345678`). Used as login identifier. Must be unique. Stored canonicalised — formatting you send (spaces, dashes, parentheses) is stripped. See [Contact formats](../README.md#contact-formats-phone--email). |
| `password` | string | **conditionally** | Min 6 characters. **Required for every role EXCEPT `customer`** — see the note below. |
| `name` | string | ✅ | Min 2 characters. Used for all roles. |
| `role` | string | ❌ | One of: `customer`, `vendor`, `agency`, `agent`. **Defaults to `vendor`** — a body that omits it registers a vendor, so send it explicitly. `admin` is refused. |
| `email` | string | ❌ | Optional for **every** role, including vendor. Must be unique. Validated and **lowercased** — see [Contact formats](../README.md#contact-formats-phone--email). |
| `business_name` | string | ❌ | For `vendor`. Falls back to `name`. Stored on the vendor's **Store**, not on the vendor profile — see [`role_entity` Shapes](#role_entity-shapes). |
| `agency_name` | string | ❌ | For `agency`. Falls back to `name`. Stored on the agency's **Magazin**, not on the agency profile. |
| `terms_accepted` | boolean | **conditionally** | **Must be `true` for `vendor`, `agency` and `agent`** (vendor/agency since 2026-09-28, agent from agent app 0.1.3 the same day): the person ticked "I agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy". Missing or `false` → `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` with `details.fields[].path = "terms_accepted"`. Not required for `customer` — a bot customer accepts with one button on the last onboarding step, which writes the same record (`role: "customer"`); accepted and recorded here if sent. Stored as `user.terms_acceptances[] = { role, accepted_at }`. |

> **Customer registration**: only `phone`, `name`, and `role: "customer"` are needed — but a
> storefront should not call this. Customers register in the bot; see
> [customer-auth.md](./customer-auth.md).

> ### ⚠ A customer's `password` is not required, and is IGNORED if sent
>
> Customers are passwordless in practice — they sign in through **`/login`** on WhatsApp or
> Telegram ([customer-auth.md](./customer-auth.md)). The account is created with a
> system-generated password that is hashed and disclosed to nobody, so `User.password_hash`
> stays satisfied and the reset flow has something to replace.
>
> The field is **stripped**, not merely optional: honouring a caller-supplied password would
> create accounts whose password somebody else chose and knows. A client that still sends one
> gets a normal `201` — it simply will not work at `POST /auth/login`.
>
> **Nothing changed for `vendor`, `agency` or `agent`**: a body omitting `password` for any of
> them is still a `400`, and `role` still defaults to `vendor`, so an old body with no `role`
> and no `password` is refused exactly as before.
>
> A customer who wants a real password uses `POST /auth/forgot-password`, which delivers over
> email **and** WhatsApp.

### Errors

| `error.code` | Status | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_PHONE_TAKEN` | `409` | `phone` already registered |
| `AUTH_EMAIL_TAKEN` | `409` | `email` already registered |
| `AUTH_UNSUPPORTED_ROLE` | `400` | A role the service cannot provision |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `400` | Missing/invalid fields, including a missing `password` on a non-customer role, or `terms_accepted` not `true` for a vendor, agency or agent. `details.fields[]` names them |

## POST `/auth/login`

Authenticates and sets role-scoped JWT cookies.

**Auth**: Public

### Request Body

```json
{
  "identifier": "+2348012345678",
  "password": "secret123",
  "role": "vendor"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `identifier` | string | ✅ | Phone number **in E.164** (`+2348012345678`) or email address. Whichever it is, it must be valid — see [Contact formats](../README.md#contact-formats-phone--email). |
| `password` | string | ✅ | Account password |
| `role` | string | ❌ | Required if the user has multiple roles. |

> If the user only has one role, `role` can be omitted — it will be resolved automatically.

> **Note:** the identifier is normalised before lookup (emails lowercased, phone formatting
> stripped), so `Ada@Example.COM` and `+234 801 234 5678` both resolve. A phone identifier that is
> not E.164 is rejected with `VALIDATION_ERROR` rather than failing as bad credentials.

### Response `200`

Sets cookies `access_token` and `refresh_token`.

```json

### Errors

| `error.code` | Status | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS` | `401` | Unknown identifier, or the wrong password |
| `AUTH_ROLE_REQUIRED` | `400` | The account holds several roles and `role` was not specified |
| `AUTH_ROLE_NOT_FOUND` | `403` | The requested `role` is not on the account. ⚠ **No `details`** — see the note under this table |
| `AUTH_ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED` | `403` | `User.status` is not `active`. Raised **after** the password is verified, so it is never an oracle for which accounts exist |
| `AUTH_VENDOR_SUSPENDED` | `403` | The vendor **profile** is `inactive` — a different axis from the account above, and its own code because the remedy differs |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `400` | `identifier` is not a well-formed E.164 phone or email address, or `password` is empty |

## POST `/auth/logout`

Clears both auth cookies. Always succeeds — safe to call even when not logged in.

**Auth**: Public

### Request Body

None.

### Response `200`

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": null,
  "message": "Logged out successfully"
}
```

---

## POST `/auth/browser/refresh`

Issues a new `access_token` cookie using the `refresh_token` cookie.

> **Note:** There is **no** `POST /auth/refresh` on the main auth router. Three refresh paths exist:
> 1. **Automatic (recommended for cookie clients):** `requireAuth` performs a *silent refresh*
>    from the `refresh_token` **cookie** whenever the access token is missing or expired,
>    transparently re-issuing the access cookie — so browser clients rarely refresh explicitly.
>    It fires on a **cookie** or on no credential at all; it deliberately will **not** fire for a
>    caller who presented an expired `Authorization: Bearer` (see below).
> 2. **Explicit, cookie:** `POST /auth/browser/refresh` (this endpoint), for clients that want to
>    refresh proactively. Re-issues the **access cookie only**.
> 3. **Explicit, bearer:** [`POST /auth/mobile/refresh`](#post-authmobilerefresh), which takes the
>    refresh token in the body and returns a **fresh pair**.

> ⚠️ **A bearer caller with an expired access token gets `401 AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED`, never a
> silent refresh** — even if a `refresh_token` cookie happens to be attached. Refreshing from an
> ambient cookie would authenticate the request as whoever that cookie belongs to while the
> client kept sending its own expired token, which is a bug that is close to undiagnosable from
> the client side. Bearer clients refresh explicitly, through path 3. (Earlier revisions of this
> page said bearer callers "must re-login on expiry"; that stopped being true when
> `/auth/mobile/refresh` shipped.)

**Auth**: Public (uses `refresh_token` cookie automatically)

### Request Body

None.

### Response `200`

Sets a new `access_token` cookie.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { "user": { "id": "664abc...", "role": "vendor" } },
  "message": "Access token refreshed"
}
```

### Errors

Identical to [`POST /auth/mobile/refresh`](#errors--the-client-behaves-differently-for-each) —
both go through the same `rotateRefreshToken`, so the two cannot drift on what counts as a
valid session.

| `error.code` | Status | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_MISSING_TOKEN` | `401` | No `refresh_token` cookie on the request |
| `AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_INVALID` | `401` | Malformed, wrong signature, **or an *access* token presented** — the `type: "refresh"` claim is checked |
| `AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED` | `401` | The refresh token's own 30 days elapsed |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD_CHANGED` | `401` | The password changed after this token was minted. **Terminal — do not retry** |
| `AUTH_SESSION_CAP_REACHED` | `401` | The sign-in is older than 90 days. **Terminal — do not retry** |
| `AUTH_ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED` | `403` | `User.status` is no longer `active` |
| `AUTH_ACCOUNT_CLOSED` | `403` | The account was **closed by its owner**. Checked *before* suspension and with its own code, because the 30-day refresh cookie otherwise outlives a closure by a month (`auth.service.ts:134-136`). **Terminal — sign out; there is no path back** |
| `AUTH_ROLE_NOT_FOUND` | `403` | The refresh token names a role that cannot be signed in as (`isAuthenticatableRole`, `auth.service.ts:204-206`). **Terminal — it is deliberately NOT `AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED`**, because a client that cannot tell the two apart retries forever |
| `AUTH_USER_NOT_FOUND` | `401` | The account no longer exists |

> ⚠ **This table omitted BOTH 403s until 2026-09-06, and `AUTH_ACCOUNT_CLOSED` appeared nowhere
> in this entire `auth/` directory** despite being raised at four sites — the rotation above
> (`auth.service.ts:134-136`), `login` (`:337`), `requireAuth` (`auth.middleware.ts:205`) and
> the password reset (`password-reset.service.ts:245`). A client branching this table's seven
> codes fell through to a generic handler on the two that are **terminal**, and retried a
> session that can never come back.
>
> ⚠ **Both 403s are terminal; four of the five 401s are not.** Status alone does not separate
> them here — branch on the code.

## Mobile namespace — bearer clients

`/auth/mobile/*` exists for clients that **cannot hold a cookie**. Two things are true of a
Capacitor / React Native WebView at once, and neither is fixable client-side:

1. Its origin is `capacitor://localhost` (iOS) or `https://localhost` (Android), so a cookie
   for the API host is a **third-party cookie** and is blocked by default.
2. `Set-Cookie` is a **forbidden response-header name** in the Fetch standard — stripped from
   every `Response.headers` object in every engine — so it cannot scrape the token out of the
   response the way a native HTTP client (the agent app's Dio stack) can.

**There is no client-type header.** The namespace *is* the switch. Nothing about your request
selects a mode, so a browser's behaviour cannot change by accident and there is no extra header
to add to a CORS allow-list.

### What is the same

Everything except delivery. Same `AuthService`, same claims, same secrets, same 15-minute /
30-day lifetimes, same error codes, same password-epoch revocation, same suspension checks. A
rule added to login or role resolution applies to both namespaces without anyone remembering to.

### What is different

- The pair comes back as `data.tokens`.
- **No cookie is set.** Not a smaller one, not a redundant one — none.
- `Content-Type: application/json` is **not** required (the browser namespace's
  `requireJsonContent` is a CSRF mitigation, and there is no ambient credential here to forge
  with). Send JSON anyway; the body parser expects it.
- There is **no `/auth/mobile/logout`**. Discard the tokens locally. `POST /auth/logout` also
  works and is a harmless no-op for you.

### The `tokens` object

```jsonc
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user":        { "...": "identical to the cookie endpoint" },
    "role":        "agency",
    "role_entity": { "...": "identical to the cookie endpoint" },
    "tokens": {
      "accessToken":      "eyJhbGciOi...",
      "refreshToken":     "eyJhbGciOi...",
      "accessExpiresIn":  900,
      "refreshExpiresIn": 2592000
    }
  }
}
```

`accessExpiresIn` / `refreshExpiresIn` are **seconds**, and they are the exact values passed to
`jwt.sign` as `expiresIn` — not a second reading of the same configuration. Refresh
**proactively** off them (≈60s before `accessExpiresIn` elapses) rather than waiting for a 401;
it costs fewer requests against the rate limiter and avoids a user-visible stall.

### Storage

Store both in the **iOS Keychain / Android Keystore**, never plain preferences. Refresh tokens
are stateless JWTs with no revocation store, so a stolen one stays valid until it expires or
the account's password changes. See [Known limitation](#known-limitation) below.

---

### POST `/auth/mobile/login`

Same body as [`POST /auth/login`](#post-authlogin). **`200`** with `tokens` added, no cookies.

### POST `/auth/mobile/register`

Same body as [`POST /auth/register`](#post-authregister). **`201`** with `tokens` added.

### GET `/auth/mobile/auth-me/:role`

**Auth**: Required (bearer). Same payload as [`GET /auth/auth-me/:role`](#get-authauth-merole),
plus `tokens`.

> **Do not skip this one.** It is the only endpoint that re-issues **both** tokens for an
> already-signed-in caller, which is what restarts the 30-day window on app launch. Without it,
> `refreshExpiresIn` counts down from the last password entry regardless of how much the app is
> used. `POST /auth/mobile/refresh` also slides the window, so calling either is enough — but
> `auth-me` is the one that also returns fresh profile state.

### POST `/auth/mobile/add-role`

**Auth**: Required (bearer). Same body as [`POST /auth/add-role`](#post-authadd-role).
**`201`**, and the returned pair is scoped to the **newly added** role — replace your stored
tokens with it or the next request is still scoped to the old role.

### POST `/auth/mobile/refresh`

**Auth**: Public — the refresh token *is* the credential.

```jsonc
{ "refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOi..." }
```

**Response `200`**

```jsonc
{ "success": true, "data": { "tokens": { "accessToken": "...", "refreshToken": "...",
                                         "accessExpiresIn": 900, "refreshExpiresIn": 2592000 } } }
```

**It returns a fresh pair, not just an access token** — unlike `/auth/browser/refresh`. Because
refresh tokens are stateless with no server-side store, minting a new one does not invalidate
the old one, so there is no rotation window to get wrong. Every refresh therefore **slides the
30-day window**, and an actively-used session never hard-expires.

**Replace both stored tokens on every refresh.** Keeping the old refresh token still works
(the old one is not invalidated), but you lose the sliding window, which is the point.

> ⚠ **A JWT's `iat` is in whole seconds**, so two mints in the same second for the same
> `{userId, role}` are **byte-identical**. Log in and immediately refresh, and the "new" access
> token can equal the old string. It is a correct, valid token either way — but never use "did
> the token string change?" as the signal that a refresh succeeded. Use the HTTP status.

#### Errors — the client behaves differently for each

| `error.code` | Status | What it means | Do |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_MISSING_TOKEN` | 401 | No `refreshToken` in the body | Sign out |
| `AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_INVALID` | 401 | Malformed, wrong signature, **or an *access* token posted here** (the `type: "refresh"` claim is checked) | Sign out. If you see this in development, check you are not sending the wrong half of the pair |
| `AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED` | 401 | The refresh token's own 30 days elapsed | Sign out, prompt login |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD_CHANGED` | 401 | The account's password changed after this token was minted | Sign out **immediately, and do not retry** — every token you hold is refused by the same rule. Worth surfacing verbatim: for someone who did not change their password, it is the first sign that somebody else did |
| `AUTH_SESSION_CAP_REACHED` | 401 | The sign-in itself is older than 90 days | Sign out, prompt login. **Terminal — do not retry** |
| `AUTH_ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED` | 403 | The account was suspended | Sign out, show the reason |
| `AUTH_ACCOUNT_CLOSED` | 403 | The account was **closed by its owner**. Checked before suspension and with its own code, because a 30-day refresh token otherwise outlives a closure by a month (`auth.service.ts:134-136`) | Sign out. **Terminal — there is no path back**, so do not offer a retry |
| `AUTH_ROLE_NOT_FOUND` | 403 | The refresh token names a role that cannot be signed in as (`auth.service.ts:204-206`) | Sign out. **Terminal**, and deliberately not `AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED` — a client that cannot tell the two apart retries forever |
| `AUTH_USER_NOT_FOUND` | 401 | The account no longer exists | Sign out |

> ⚠ **This table was missing three codes until 2026-09-06** — both 403s above and
> `AUTH_SESSION_CAP_REACHED`. All three come out of the same `rotateRefreshToken` the section
> above says the two routes share, so the cookie table and this one were short by the same rows.
> **Status does not separate terminal from retryable here**: both 403s are terminal, and so are
> two of the six 401s. Branch on the code.

#### Maintenance windows

This route is **exempt from `readonly` maintenance** and blocked in `down`. It mints a token
and writes nothing, and it is a bearer client's only renewal path — a cookie client renews
inside an ordinary GET, so without the exemption a read-only window would sign out every native
client fifteen minutes in while browsers carried on.

---

## GET `/auth/me`

Returns the current user with the active role and its role entity.

**Auth**: Required

> **It re-issues nothing.** `data` is read straight off the verified token's resolved identity;
> no new cookie is minted and no `tokens` object exists. (A cookie client may still get a fresh
> `access_token` cookie on this call — that is `requireAuth`'s silent refresh firing because the
> access cookie had expired, not this endpoint doing it.) To deliberately re-issue, use
> [`GET /auth/auth-me/:role`](#get-authauth-merole).

### Response `200`

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "_id": "664abc...",
      "login_phone": "+2348012345678",
      "roles": ["vendor"],
      "status": "active"
    },
    "role": "vendor",
    "role_entity": { "_id": "664def...", "display_name": "John Doe", "onboarding_step": 0 }
  }
}
```

---

## GET `/auth/auth-me/:role`

Re-authenticates and returns full user + role entity + fresh cookies. **Use on app launch to restore session state.**

**Auth**: Required

**URL Params**: `:role` — **required**, and one of the four authenticatable roles. It is a path
segment, so there is no "resolve it for me" form of this route; pass the role you want the
session scoped to.

### Response `200`

Sets fresh `access_token` and `refresh_token` cookies.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": { "_id": "...", "roles": ["vendor", "customer"], "..." : "..." },
    "role": "vendor",
    "role_entity": {
      "_id": "...",
      "display_name": "John Doe",
      "onboarding_step": 1,
      "status": "pending_verification",
      "..." : "..."
    }
  }
}
```

> Check `data.role_entity.onboarding_step` to route to onboarding or dashboard.

### Errors

| `error.code` | Status | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_MISSING_TOKEN` | `401` | No valid token reached the handler |
| `AUTH_ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND` | `401` | The `userId` in the token no longer exists |
| `AUTH_ROLE_NOT_FOUND` | `403` | The account does not hold `:role`. ⚠ **No `details`** — see [the note on `/auth/login`](#post-authlogin) |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `400` | `:role` is not one of the four authenticatable roles |
| `AUTH_SESSION_CAP_REACHED` | `401` | The sign-in is older than 90 days. **Terminal** |

---

## POST `/auth/add-role`

Adds a second role to an **already authenticated** user. Sets cookies scoped to the newly added role.

**Auth**: Required

### Request Body

```json
{
  "role": "customer",
  "name": "John Doe"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `role` | string | ✅ | The new role to add — `customer`, `vendor`, `agency` or `agent`. **`admin` is refused**; see [Roles](#roles) |
| `name` | string | ❌ | For `customer` and `agent` |
| `business_name` | string | ❌ | For `vendor`. Provisions the Store |
| `agency_name` | string | ❌ | For `agency`. Provisions the Magazin |
| `terms_accepted` | boolean | **conditionally** | **Must be `true` when adding `vendor`, `agency` or `agent`**, same rule and same `VALIDATION_ERROR` as [register](#post-authregister). Appends `{ role, accepted_at }` to `user.terms_acceptances` in the same update that adds the role |

> **The new pair does not restart the 90-day clock.** This route sits behind `requireAuth`, so
> the caller presented a token rather than a credential; `auth_time` is copied from the token
> they came in with. Same for `auth-me`. See [The 90-day absolute cap](#the-90-day-absolute-cap).

> **An account with no email can add any role, `vendor` included.** The new role profile copies
> the account's email and phone as they are, and no role profile requires an email — so an
> agent, agency or customer who signed up by phone gets a profile with no email. **Until
> 2026-09-21 `vendor` was the exception**: its profile alone required one, and the request
> failed with an undocumented `500`. To add an email afterwards, use
> [`PATCH /api/me/email`](../me/contact-change.md); once confirmed it is written onto every
> role profile, the vendor's included. Until then `POST /auth/send-email-verification` answers
> `422 AUTH_EMAIL_MISSING` for that role.

### Response `201`

Sets fresh cookies scoped to the **newly added role**.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": { "_id": "...", "roles": ["vendor", "customer"], "..." : "..." },
    "role": "customer",
    "role_entity": { "_id": "...", "name": "John Doe", "onboarding_step": 0, "..." : "..." }
  }
}
```

### Errors

| `error.code` | Status | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_ROLE_ALREADY_EXISTS` | `409` | The account already holds that role. `details.role` echoes it |
| `AUTH_ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND` | `404` | The `userId` in the token no longer exists |
| `AUTH_UNSUPPORTED_ROLE` | `400` | A role the service cannot provision |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `400` | `role` is not one of the four authenticatable roles, or `name` is under 2 characters |
| `AUTH_MISSING_TOKEN` | `401` | No valid token |

---

## POST `/auth/send-email-verification`

Sends a verification link to the email on the user's **current role entity**. Valid for **24 hours**.

**Auth**: Required

### Where the link points

```
{STOREFRONT_URL}/verify-email?token=<64 hex>&app=<customer|vendor|agency|agent>
```

A **page**, not this API. It used to be `{API_PUBLIC_URL}/api/auth/verify-email?token=…`, so a
person who clicked it got a raw JSON envelope with no branding and no way onward, and — worse —
a `GET` that mutates is spent by whatever prefetches the mail (link scanners, corporate relays,
the mail client's own preview) before the person ever taps it. The page holds the token and
POSTs it when a human acts.

`app` is the role that requested verification, taken from the JWT. **One page serves all four
apps**, because confirming an email is role-free; the only thing it cannot work out for itself
is where to send the person afterwards, so the origin travels in the link. It is a **role key,
never a URL** — the page maps it through a compile-time table and ignores anything else.

`STOREFRONT_URL` falls back to `API_PUBLIC_URL` when unset, which keeps a local box working —
the same precedence the password-reset and email-change links use.

### Request Body

None. The `userId` and `role` are read from the JWT.

### Response `200`

```json
{ "success": true, "data": { "message": "Verification email sent" } }
```

### Errors

| `error.code` | Status | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_EMAIL_ALREADY_VERIFIED` | `409` | Already verified |
| `AUTH_EMAIL_MISSING` | `422` | The role entity has no email address to send to |
| `AUTH_PROFILE_NOT_FOUND` | `404` | No role entity for the token's active role. `details.role` echoes it |

---

## POST `/auth/verify-email`

> Frontend hand-off for this change:
> [FRONTEND-CHANGELOG-email-verification.md](../FRONTEND-CHANGELOG-email-verification.md).

Confirms the email address. **This is what the emailed page calls.**

**Auth**: Public — the token arrives in a mail client, routinely a different browser and often a
different device, so requiring a session would fail the flow for exactly the people it is for.
The token is the credential and it names the account.

### Request Body

```json
{ "token": "abc123def456..." }
```

`.strict()` — an unknown key is a `400` on the whole request. Bounded at 512 characters, which
is generous on purpose: the token is 64 hex characters, and a mail client that wraps a URL is a
real thing, so a near-miss should be told the token is *invalid*, not that it is *malformed*.

### Response `200`

```json
{ "success": true, "data": { "message": "Email verified successfully" } }
```

The token is valid for **24 hours** and is single-use. It marks `email_verified` on the role
entity the verification was requested for, and **signs nobody in**.

⚠ **It no longer ACTIVATES a vendor, and that changed on 2026-09-15.** Verifying an email used to
promote a vendor from `pending_verification` to `active` — for the vendor role only, which is how
the three business roles ended up with three different answers to "when is an account active?".
Activation is now one rule for all three; see [Account activation](#account-activation) below.
Clicking the link still verifies the address and nothing else. **No vendor was demoted** — those
already `active` from an email verification stay active.

### Errors

| `error.code` | Status | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_VERIFY_TOKEN_INVALID` | `400` | Unknown, expired **or already spent** — one code for all three |

---

## GET `/auth/verify-email` — legacy

Identical behaviour, different verb. **No new mail points here.**

It survives only because tokens live 24 hours, so links minted before the cutover stay valid for
a day after it. Prefer the `POST` in every new client: this is a `GET` that mutates, so the token
is spent by whatever prefetches the URL.

**Auth**: Public

### Query Parameters

| Param | Type | Required |
|-------|------|----------|
| `token` | string | ✅ |

**Example**: `GET /api/auth/verify-email?token=abc123def456...`

### Errors

| `error.code` | Status | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_VERIFY_TOKEN_INVALID` | `400` | `token` missing from the query string, unknown, expired **or already spent** — one code for all four |

---

## ~~POST `/auth/request-wa-verification`~~ — removed

This endpoint no longer exists. It minted a code the user carried to the WhatsApp bot as
`/link:CODE`.

Connecting a messaging account is no longer an auth concern at all. The direction is inverted —
**the bot mints the code and the user redeems it** — and the surface is
`POST /api/me/connections`, which is role-agnostic, covers Telegram as well as WhatsApp, and
does not bind to a single role. See [../connections/README.md](../connections/README.md).

---

## Account activation

**Owner decision, 2026-09-15.** Two questions used to be answered by one field, and they are now
answered by two:

| | Question | Who answers it | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`status`** | May this account operate? | the account holder | `role_entity.status` |
| **KYC** | Has a human vetted this business? | an administrator | `kyc_details.status` / `kyc.status` |

**An account activates itself.** A vendor, agency or agent moves from `pending_verification` to
`active` as soon as it has **a verified phone number and a name** — nothing else, and nobody else.
Registration creates every role entity at `pending_verification`; the promotion happens on the call
that proves the phone (`POST /api/me/phone/verify/confirm`, or a confirmed contact change).

⚠ **`status: "active"` therefore no longer means "an administrator approved this business".**
Anything you were deriving from that — a trust badge, a warning banner, a gate — must read the KYC
verdict instead. Vendor and agency expose `kyc_details.status`; an agent exposes `kyc.status`.

⚠ **This is a real behaviour change for each role, in a different direction:**

- **Vendor** — *lost* a path. Email verification used to activate; it no longer does. A vendor who
  verifies their email and stops stays `pending_verification`.
- **Agency** — *gained* one. Administrative approval used to be the only way to become `active`;
  now the agency activates itself, and approval writes only the verdict.
- **Agent** — *gained* one. Nothing promoted an agent at all: every agent sat at
  `pending_verification` until an administrator moved them by hand.

⚠ **Only `pending_verification` is ever promoted.** An `inactive` or `suspended` account that
proves a phone stays exactly where an administrator put it — proving a number cannot lift a
suspension.

⚠ **Activating an agent does not make them dispatchable.** `status` is only one of the ordered
eligibility rules: a platform ban refuses them before it is consulted, and an active contract plus
Tracking Allow are required after it. Holding COD cash is gated on KYC, never on `status`. (Until
2026-09-27 unverified KYC was also an eligibility rule; it now refuses **COD shipments only**.)

**What being unverified actually costs**: **COD cash**. An agency that no administrator has
verified cannot carry cash-on-delivery orders, and (since 2026-09-27) an unverified agent cannot be
dispatched a COD shipment. An unverified owner's payout is **not** limited — the allowance that
could cap it (2026-09-15) was deleted 2026-09-27 (see
[admin/payout-requests.md](../admin/payout-requests.md)). Everything else is
open by design — the platform's position is that working with an unverified counterparty is a
business judgement for the vendor or agency to make, not a refusal for the platform to issue.

---

## Post-Login / Registration Routing

After a successful login, registration, or `auth-me`, read `role_entity.onboarding_step` from the response:

```
onboarding_step === 0  →  Route to role dashboard
onboarding_step  > 0  →  Route to onboarding screen for that step
```

> **Customers** always return `onboarding_step: 0` — the schema caps it there. Route them
> directly to the dashboard. Vendor, agency and agent are the three roles with onboarding.

---

## Onboarding Flow

Onboarding is **field-presence driven**: every profile write recalculates `onboarding_step` from scratch. The server always reports the next incomplete step.

> **The three roles do NOT share one shape.** Vendor and agency use a **`PUT` per step**; only
> the agent has a single `PATCH …/onboarding/step` endpoint. The old
> `PATCH /api/vendor/onboarding/step` and `PATCH /api/agency/onboarding/step` were removed and
> no longer exist. This page is a summary — the field-by-field contracts are in
> [vendor/onboarding.md](../vendor/onboarding.md), [agency/onboarding.md](../agency/onboarding.md)
> and [agent/onboarding.md](../agent/onboarding.md).

### Vendor Onboarding — four `PUT` steps

**Auth**: Required (`vendor` role). Full contract: [vendor/onboarding.md](../vendor/onboarding.md).

| Step | Value | Label | Endpoint | Required? |

| `BASIC_SETUP` | `1` | Basic Setup | `PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/basic-setup` | ✅ |
| `DELIVERY_LINKING` | `2` | Delivery Linking | `PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/delivery-linking` | skippable |

| `POLICY_SETUP` | `4` | Policy Setup | `PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/policy-setup` | skippable |
| `COMPLETED` | `0` | Done | — | — |

Reads: `GET /api/vendor/onboarding/status` (rich: `steps[]`, `progressPercent`, `completedFields`,
`warnings`) and `GET /api/vendor/profile/completion-status` (step + missing fields only).

> **Step 2 no longer selects an agency.** It is a plain step-advance. A default delivery agency

Every `PUT` step accepts an optional `version` integer for optimistic concurrency
(`409 VENDOR_ONBOARDING_CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION` on a mismatch), and every one returns
`{ success, data: { profile, completionStatus } }`. Once `onboarding_step === 0`, all four
answer `409 VENDOR_ONBOARDING_ALREADY_COMPLETED` — edit via `PATCH /api/vendor/profile` instead.

---

### Customer Onboarding

**No onboarding flow.** `onboarding_step` is always `0`.

Route customers directly to the customer dashboard after login or registration.

Profile updates (name, avatar, bio, preferences, addresses, etc.) are handled through:

```
GET   /api/customer/profile
PATCH /api/customer/profile
```

---

### Agency Onboarding — an init call, then four `PUT` steps

**Auth**: Required (`agency` role). Full contract: [agency/onboarding.md](../agency/onboarding.md).

| Step | Value | Label | Endpoint | Required? |
|------|-------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Init | — | Agency Initialization | `POST /api/agency` | ✅ |
| `LOGISTICS_SETUP` | `1` | Logistics Setup | `PUT /api/agency/onboarding/logistics` | ✅ |
| `PAYOUT_SETUP` | `2` | Payout Setup | `PUT /api/agency/onboarding/payout` | ✅ |
| `BRANDING` | `3` | Branding | `PUT /api/agency/onboarding/branding` | skippable |
| `POLICY_SETUP` | `4` | Policy Setup | `PUT /api/agency/onboarding/policies` | ✅ |
| `COMPLETED` | `0` | Done | — | — |

Read: `GET /api/agency/onboarding/status`. Same `version` concurrency field, raising
`409 DELIVERY_ONBOARDING_CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION`.

---

### Agent Onboarding — one `PATCH`, two steps

**Base**: `PATCH /api/agent/onboarding/step` — the one role that still uses the single-endpoint
shape. **Auth**: Required (`agent` role). Full contract: [agent/onboarding.md](../agent/onboarding.md).

| Step | Value | Label | Body |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| `VEHICLE_SETUP` | `1` | Vehicle Setup | `{ step: 1, vehicle_info: { vehicle_type, color, plate_number?, photo_file_id? } }` |
| `IDENTITY_SETUP` | `2` | Identity (Optional) | `{ step: 2, skip?: true, avatar_url?, timezone? }` |
| `COMPLETED` | `0` | Done | — |

Read: `GET /api/agent/profile/completion-status`.

## `role_entity` Shapes

Below are the key fields returned in `role_entity` for each role. Some fields are omitted for brevity.

> ### ⚠ `role_entity` is the RAW profile document, not the profile read-model
>
> Every auth route resolves it with a plain `findByUserId`, so what you get is the stored
> document — **not** the shape `GET /api/{role}/profile` returns. Two differences bite:
>
> - **Avatars come back as `avatar_file_id` (an id or `null`)**, not as the
>   `{ id, key, url, access, mimeType, size, originalName }` object the profile endpoints resolve.
>   To render an avatar, read the profile endpoint; do not try to build a URL from this id.
> - **The business name is absent**, for vendor and agency alike — see below.
>
> Use `role_entity` for **routing** (`onboarding_step`, `status`) and identity, and the role's
> own profile endpoint for display.

## Token Details

### Access Token Payload

```json
{
  "userId": "664abc...",
  "role": "vendor",
  "auth_time": 1708000000,
  "iat": 1708000000,
  "exp": 1708000900
}
```

- Expiry: **15 minutes** (env: `AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL`, in seconds)
- Signing: `HS256` with `JWT_SECRET`

### Refresh Token Payload

```json
{
  "userId": "664abc...",
  "role": "vendor",
  "type": "refresh",
  "auth_time": 1708000000,
  "iat": 1708000000,
  "exp": 1710592000
}
```

- Expiry: **30 days** (env: `AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL`, in seconds)
- Signing: `HS256` with `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` (falls back to `JWT_SECRET`)
- `type: "refresh"` is **checked** on both refresh paths, so posting an access token to a
  refresh endpoint is refused rather than quietly accepted

> **`auth_time` is on both halves, and it is not `iat`.** It is the second at which the account
> holder last *proved* a credential — stamped fresh at login, registration, a bot-issued
> sign-in and a password change, and **copied unchanged** through every refresh and every
> `auth-me`. `iat` moves on every re-issue; `auth_time` does not. That is what makes the
> [90-day cap](#the-90-day-absolute-cap) measure the sign-in rather than the token.
>
> A token minted before this claim existed carries none, and is dated from its own `iat`
> instead. Neither claim is a client concern — do not parse or branch on them; read the
> published `accessExpiresIn` / `refreshExpiresIn` instead.

### Revocation — `iat` is load-bearing

Both tokens are **stateless**: the server keeps no list of issued tokens, so there is nothing
to delete when a session must end. Changing the account password is what revokes them. The
change stamps a per-account instant, and **both** credential paths refuse any token whose
`iat` predates it:

| Path | Refuses with |
|---|---|
| every authenticated request (`requireAuth`, access token) | `401 AUTH_PASSWORD_CHANGED` |
| silent refresh, `POST /auth/browser/refresh` **and `POST /auth/mobile/refresh`** (refresh token) | `401 AUTH_PASSWORD_CHANGED` |

Practical consequences for a client:

- **Treat `AUTH_PASSWORD_CHANGED` as terminal.** Do not retry and do not attempt a refresh —
  the refresh cookie is refused by the same rule. Clear local state and send the user to
  sign-in. The message is worth surfacing verbatim: for someone who did *not* change their
  password, it is the first sign that somebody else did.
- The caller who performs the change **keeps their session** — `PATCH /api/me/password`
  returns a fresh cookie pair in the same response. See [me/password.md](../me/password.md).
- Everything else signs out on its next request: other browsers, other devices, and any
  bearer token that was minted earlier.

## Complete Auth Flows

### Flow A — New Registration + Onboarding (Vendor)

```
1. POST /api/auth/register   { phone, password, name, role: "vendor", email, business_name }
      → Sets access_token + refresh_token cookies
      → Returns { user, role_entity }
      → role_entity.onboarding_step === 1 → route to onboarding

2. PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/basic-setup       { country, timezone, payout_details }
      → Returns { profile, completionStatus }
      → completionStatus.onboardingStep → 2

3. PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/delivery-linking  { }        (a plain step-advance)
      → completionStatus.onboardingStep → 3

4. PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/branding          { skip: true }  OR provide branding
      → completionStatus.onboardingStep → 4

5. PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/policy-setup      { skip: true }  OR provide policies
      → completionStatus.isComplete === true → route to vendor dashboard
```

### Flow B — Customer registration + sign-in (no password, no form)

The storefront calls **nothing** to register a customer. Full contract:
[customer-auth.md](./customer-auth.md).

```
1. Storefront "Create account"
      → deep-link the user into the WhatsApp or Telegram bot
      → the account is created on their first interaction with it
        (bot-side; nothing for the frontend to call)

2. The user sends  /login  to the bot
      → the bot replies with a magic LINK and an 8-character CODE
      → both live 10 minutes, single use, spending either kills the other

3a. LINK  → it lands on YOUR page, STOREFRONT_URL/login/magic?t=<token>
       → that page POSTs it:  POST /api/auth/magic/link  { token }

3b. CODE  → the user types it on your sign-in form beside their phone or email
       → POST /api/auth/magic/code  { identifier, code }

4. Either one sets access_token + refresh_token cookies
      → { role: "customer", user }
      → role_entity is NOT returned here; onboarding_step is always 0 for a
        customer, so route straight to the customer dashboard
```

> `POST /auth/register` with `role: "customer"` still works and still returns a session — it is
> simply not the storefront's path, and the password it accepts is stripped and replaced.

### Flow C — Login (vendor · agency · agent)

```
1. POST /api/auth/login   { identifier, password, role }
      → Sets access_token + refresh_token cookies
      → Returns { user, role, role_entity }
      → Check role_entity.onboarding_step for routing

A customer reaching this flow gets 401 AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS unless they have
run a password reset — see Flow B.
```

### Flow D — Restoring Session on App Launch

```
1. GET /api/auth/auth-me/:role   (using existing access_token cookie)
      → Refreshes both cookies
      → Returns { user, role, role_entity }
      → Check role_entity.onboarding_step for routing
```

### Flow E — Expired Access Token

```
Cookie clients (browsers, and any native client sending a refresh COOKIE):
  Refresh is AUTOMATIC — requireAuth silently refreshes from the refresh_token
  cookie and re-issues the access cookie. No explicit call needed.
  (To refresh proactively: POST /api/auth/browser/refresh — access token only)

Bearer clients (/auth/mobile/*):
  NO silent refresh — an expired bearer is answered 401 AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED even
  if a refresh cookie happens to be attached. Refresh explicitly:

    POST /api/auth/mobile/refresh   { refreshToken }
      → { tokens: { accessToken, refreshToken, accessExpiresIn, refreshExpiresIn } }
      → replace BOTH stored tokens; the 30-day window slides
      → 401 AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED | AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_INVALID | AUTH_PASSWORD_CHANGED
        or 403 AUTH_ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED  → sign out

  Better: refresh PROACTIVELY, ~60s before accessExpiresIn elapses, and never
  see this flow at all.
```

### Flow E′ — Mobile app lifecycle, end to end

```
1. POST /api/auth/mobile/login  { identifier, password, role }
      → { user, role, role_entity, tokens }
      → store tokens in Keychain / Keystore

2. every request:  Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
      (a stale cookie can no longer beat it — the bearer is read first)

3. ~60s before accessExpiresIn:  POST /api/auth/mobile/refresh { refreshToken }
      → replace both tokens

4. on app launch:  GET /api/auth/mobile/auth-me/:role
      → fresh profile state AND a fresh pair (restarts the 30-day window)

5. logout: discard the tokens. No server call is required.
```

### Flow F — Multi-Role Login / Role Switch

```
1. POST /api/auth/login   { identifier, password, role: "vendor" }
      → Sets cookies scoped to "vendor"
      → `role` is REQUIRED whenever the account holds more than one role;
        omitting it is 400 AUTH_ROLE_REQUIRED

(to switch to another role the account already holds — no password:)
2. GET /api/auth/auth-me/agency          (…/mobile/auth-me/agency for bearer)
      → Re-issues the pair scoped to "agency" and returns that role_entity
      → 403 AUTH_ROLE_NOT_FOUND if the account does not hold it

Re-posting /auth/login with a different `role` also works and is what a client
does when it has no live session. Prefer auth-me when it does: it needs no
password, and it does NOT restart the 90-day cap (auth_time is copied).
```

### Flow G — Adding a Second Role

```
1. POST /api/auth/add-role   { role: "customer", name: "John Doe" }
      → Creates customer profile for the logged-in user
      → Sets cookies scoped to "customer"
      → Returns { user, role: "customer", role_entity }
```

### Flow H — Logout

```
1. POST /api/auth/logout
      → Clears both cookies
      → Returns { success: true, data: null, message: "Logged out successfully" }
      → Redirect to login page

   Bearer clients: discard the tokens locally. Calling this is harmless but does
   nothing for you — there are no cookies to clear, and see below for why there
   is no server-side revocation to invoke.
```

---

## Known limitation

Tokens here are **stateless JWTs with no revocation store**, so there is nothing to delete when
a session must end. Consequences, stated plainly rather than left to be discovered:

- **A stolen refresh token stays valid until it expires.** Logging out does not revoke it —
  logging out only discards your own copy.
- **A password change is the only thing that kills one *on demand*,** via the `iat` epoch
  above. It is the correct remedy after a compromise, and it evicts every session on every
  device except the one performing the change.
- **The 30-day window slides, but the SIGN-IN is capped at 90 days.** Each refresh and each
  `auth-me` still re-issues both tokens at full lifetime, so an actively-used session never
  hard-expires on inactivity — but it does end on the calendar. See below.

### The 90-day absolute cap

Every token carries an **`auth_time`** claim: the second at which the account holder last
*proved* a credential. It is set at login, at registration, at a bot-issued sign-in and at a
password change — and **copied unchanged** through every refresh and every `auth-me`. It is not
`iat`, which moves on every re-issue.

Once `now − auth_time` exceeds **90 days**, every credential path refuses:

```
401  { "success": false,
"requestId": "3f8a1c74-9b2e-4d10-8c55-6a0f2b7e19dd",
       "error": { "code": "AUTH_SESSION_CAP_REACHED",
                  "statusCode": 401,
                  "category": "authentication",
                  "message": "It's been a while — please sign in again" } }
```

**What a client must do: route to the login screen. Never retry, and never treat it as a
transient failure.** This is the one 401 on this API that no credential you hold can fix —
refreshing produces the same answer, because the claim that failed is copied into whatever the
refresh would mint. A client that retries will loop until it is killed.

Tell it apart from its neighbours, all of which are also 401:

| Code | Meaning | What the client does |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED` | the 15-minute access token lapsed | refresh, then replay the request |
| `AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED` | the refresh token itself lapsed or was rejected | sign in again |
| `AUTH_SESSION_CAP_REACHED` | **the sign-in is 90 days old** | sign in again — **do not retry** |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD_CHANGED` | the password changed since this token was minted | sign in again, and consider warning the user |

Cookie clients meet this as an ordinary redirect to a login page. **Bearer clients meet it as a
visible sign-out**, because there is no silent renewal inside an ordinary request the way a
browser has — so it is worth handling deliberately rather than as a generic 401.

The window is configurable per deployment (`AUTH_ABSOLUTE_SESSION_CAP`, seconds); 90 days is the
default and the documented policy. Design record: `docs/ADR-A03-SESSION-CAP.md`.

A session that predates this feature is capped from the moment its current token was minted
(at most 30 days ago) and gains a real `auth_time` on its first refresh — **nobody was signed
out when this shipped.**

The mitigation that is in force is client-side: **store tokens in the iOS Keychain / Android
Keystore, never plain preferences.** If a server-side revocation store is wanted later, the
cheapest hook is `AuthService.rotateRefreshToken`, which already loads the user row on every
refresh — a `token_version` compared there would cost no extra query.
