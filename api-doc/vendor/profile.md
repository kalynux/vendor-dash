# Vendor Profile Management API Documentation

**Verified against source on 2026-09-08** — R7 re-checked the profile routes against the live route dump and the four sharp behaviours against `modules/vendor/service/vendor-profile.service.ts:227,334,347-352,400`. No defects found.

**Verified against source on 2026-09-06** — every claim on this page was checked against
`jovi-mall/src/`, including the whole inherited defect list that `vendor-dash` carried for it
(DOC-PROGRAM § 24–26). Corrections are marked inline with ⚠ and a source citation.

## Overview

The Vendor Profile Management API allows vendors to view and update their profile information, manage notification preferences, and change their password. All endpoints require authentication and are restricted to vendor accounts only.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The business name, description, logo and banner live on the [Store](./store.md), not on this profile.** This profile carries the vendor's **personal** surface (`displayName`, personal `avatar`) plus operational data (addresses, payout, policies, country/timezone). `GET /api/vendor/profile` no longer returns `businessName`, `businessDescription`, or a `branding` block — read/patch those via [`GET`/`PATCH /api/vendor/store`](./store.md). The onboarding **Branding** step still accepts `branding` (logo/cover), but it is persisted to the Store.

**Base URL**: `/api/vendor`

**Authentication**: All endpoints require a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header.

## COD terms (2026-10-02)

`GET /api/vendor/profile/cod-terms` · `PUT /api/vendor/profile/cod-terms`

```json
{ "codEnabled": true, "maxCashPerAgency": 500000 }
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `codEnabled` | boolean (default `true`) | `false` → checkout refuses cash on delivery for any order containing your items (`422 COD_VENDOR_NOT_ACCEPTED`, web and Telegram Mini App) |
| `maxCashPerAgency` | integer ≥ 0 or `null` (default `null`) | the most of your orders' COD cash one agency may hold un-remitted at once; `null` = no cap of yours (the agency's own 1 000 000 limit still applies) |

PUT replaces both (`.strict()` — both keys required, no others). The GET answers the defaults plus
`updatedAt: null` when never set. These terms are **separate from `policies`**: changing them does
**not** bump `policy_version` and does **not** pause your agency connections. Connected agencies
see them on their connection screens, and agencies with an **active** connection are notified
when a PUT actually changes a value (`connection.cod_terms_changed`; a PUT re-sending the same
terms notifies nobody, and `paused_reapproval` connections are skipped —
`CodLimitsService.publishVendorTermsChanged`). ⚠ This sentence said "they are not notified" until
2026-10-02's notification change. How the cap is applied
at dispatch: [orders.md](./orders.md#cod-limits-on-dispatch-2026-10-02).

## Delivery terms (2026-10-03, ADR-A11)

`GET /api/vendor/profile/delivery-terms` · `PUT /api/vendor/profile/delivery-terms`

Who pays the delivery fee on **your shop's part** of a customer's basket. This replaced the
per-product `freeDelivery` flag, which no longer exists (a product write that still sends it is a
`400`).

```json
{ "mode": "above", "freeAboveAmount": 20000 }
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `mode` | `"always"` · `"never"` · `"above"` (default `"always"`) | `always` — you pay delivery (free for the customer). `never` — the customer pays it. `above` — free when the customer's items **from your shop** total at least `freeAboveAmount`, customer-paid below it |
| `freeAboveAmount` | integer 1 – 100 000 000, or `null` | **required** with `above`, must be `null`/absent with the other two modes (`400` otherwise) |

PUT replaces the whole block (`.strict()` — unknown keys are a `400`). The GET answers
`{ "mode": "always", "freeAboveAmount": null, "updatedAt": null }` when never set — every shop
starts on `always`, which is the behaviour before this setting existed. Like the COD terms, these
are **separate from `policies`**: changing them does not bump `policy_version` and does not pause
agency connections. The threshold is inclusive (a basket exactly at `freeAboveAmount` is free).

The storefront publishes these terms (`deliveryTerms` on the public product and store reads); the
product's `freeDelivery` there is now derived — `true` only for `always`. How checkout charges the
fee is documented with the customer-paid delivery changelog.

> ⚠ **This table is new on 2026-09-06** (DOC-PROGRAM F-17 class 6), and the row it exists for is
> `completion-status`: it is served under `/api/vendor/profile`, and this page did not mention it
> **once**. The other three role profile pages all carry it —
> [customer](../customer/profile.md#get-customerprofilecompletion-status) and
> [agency](../agency/profile.md#get-apiagencyprofilecompletion-status) specify it in full,
> [agent](../agent/profile.md#endpoints) lists it with a pointer — which is what makes this an
> omission rather than a house style.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ⚠ **This example was missing SEVEN of the response's keys until 2026-09-06** — `country`,
> `operatingHours`, `kycVerified`, `socialLinks`, `policies`, `preferredLanguage` and
> `onboardingStep`. `GetVendorProfileResponseDto` has **22** fields
> (`vendor-profile.dto.ts:49-78`), every one of them assigned unconditionally by
> `VendorProfileMapper.toResponseDto` (`:184-211`), so all 22 are on the wire. The one
> exception is `displayName`, which is optional on the DTO and therefore absent from the JSON
> when the vendor has never set one — count on 21 or 22, never on the 15 this example showed.
>
> ⚠ **`businessAddresses[]` entries always carry `geo`, and never carry a null `location`.**
> `geo` is schema-defaulted to `null` (`vendor.model.ts:149`), so the **key is always present**
> — `null` only on legacy plain-text entries written before geocoding, populated on anything
> new or edited (see the field reference below). The deprecated `location` is
> `default: undefined` (`vendor.model.ts:143`) precisely so the key is **omitted** rather than
> stored null: this array is 2dsphere-indexed, and one entry holding an explicit `null` beside
> one holding a real point fails index-key extraction and makes **every subsequent write to
> that vendor** fail, whatever it touches (`geo-address.types.ts:169-184`, measured
> 2026-08-23). A client must not send `location: null` back either.

> [!NOTE]
> **`payoutDetails` is the PREFERRED method only** — a single object (or `null`), not the array you
> sent. You store an ordered list of up to 3; this read returns index 0, the one payouts actually
> use. It is **masked**: `mobile_money.phone_number` → `phone_number_masked`,
> `bank.account_number` → `account_number_masked`. A `card` block is not redacted because nothing
> sensitive is stored for it in the first place — no card number, no CVV, ever.
>
> Only `mobile_money` can be **configured** right now (🚧 `bank` and `card` are switched off), but a
> `bank` or `card` entry stored before the switch still reads back here exactly as shown above, with
> its own block populated. Full contract: **[Payout methods](./payout-methods.md)**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Each `businessAddresses[]` entry is identified by `_id`, not `id`.** Unlike the outer profile
> object (which is remapped to `id`), address subdocuments are passed through as-is, so they keep
> Mongoose's default `_id` key. Use this `_id` value as `vendorAddressId` when setting a physical
> product's pickup location (`PATCH /api/vendor/products/:id`, `delivery.pickupLocation.vendorAddressId`
> — see [Vendor Products — Update Product](./products.md#update-product)).
>
> **UX guidance**: don't show this `_id` to the vendor. Render the address picker using `label`
> (and `address_line1`/`city` for disambiguation if two addresses share a label), and submit the
> matching `_id` as the value under the hood — the same pattern as any labeled-option/select
> control (display text ≠ submitted value).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`avatar` is a populated file object, not a URL.** This mirrors product media (see
> [Vendor Product Upload Reference — Media Handling](./product-upload-flow.md#media-handling)):
> the vendor uploads the image via `POST /api/files/upload` and gets back a file `id`; that `id` is
> what gets submitted as `avatarFileId` via `PATCH /api/vendor/profile`. Reads always resolve the
> stored file reference into `{ id, key, url, access, mimeType, size, originalName }`, or `null` if unset.
>
> ⚠ **`url` is `string | null` on the shared `FileDetail` shape** (`product-detail.read-model.ts:40`)
> — it is `null`, with `access: "authorized"`, whenever the file sits in a private storage tree
> (`digital/`, `shipments/`, `ticket-attachments/` — ADR-A01 D-2). **A vendor avatar is never one
> of those**: it is uploaded into `images/`, which is classified `public`
> (`storage-trees.ts:40`), so here `url` is always a real URL and `access` is always `"public"`.
> Write the client against the nullable type anyway if the same rendering code also draws
> ticket attachments or delivery proof, where `null` is the normal case and the bytes come from
> the owning entity's own authorized read keyed on `id`.
>
> **`avatar` is the vendor's personal profile picture**, distinct from the **business** logo/banner,
> which live on the [Store](./store.md). Like any file reference, while set it counts as *in use*
> (it appears under `usage.references` on `GET /api/files/:id` with `entityType: "vendor", field: "avatar"`)
> and cannot be deleted until you detach it (send `avatarFileId: null`). See
> [File Management — the `usage` object](./file-management.md#get-apifilesid).

### PATCH /api/vendor/profile

Update the authenticated vendor's profile. **This is the endpoint to use for all post-onboarding edits** — including fields the vendor originally set during onboarding (payout details, branding, policies, country/timezone, etc.).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **When to use this vs. the onboarding endpoints.**
> The `PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/*` step endpoints are for the **first-time onboarding flow only**. Once onboarding is complete (`onboarding_step === 0`) they all return `409 VENDOR_ONBOARDING_ALREADY_COMPLETED`.
> To let a vendor change a previously-entered onboarding value from the **Settings UI**, send it here instead. See [Onboarding docs](./onboarding.md) for the original first-time flow.
>
> **One exception:** the default delivery agency (onboarding Step 2) is **not** editable through this endpoint — use the dedicated [`PUT /api/vendor/profile/default-delivery-agency`](#put-apivendorprofiledefault-delivery-agency) route documented below. There is no route to clear it — vendors can only change it to a different agency (see that section for why).

#### Authentication

- **Required**: Yes
- **Role**: `vendor`

#### Headers

```http
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### How to send

- **Partial update**: send **only** the fields you want to change. Omitted fields are left untouched.
- **`version` is always required** (optimistic locking — see [Optimistic Locking](#optimistic-locking)). Read it from `GET /api/vendor/profile` first.
- **Object/array fields are a full replace, not a merge.** When you send `payout_details`, `business_addresses`, `operating_hours`, `social_links`, or `policies`, the value you send **replaces** the entire stored value. To edit one entry, send the complete desired array/object (including the parts you want to keep). Omitting a field entirely leaves it unchanged — sending it with a partial value overwrites the rest.

#### Request Body (example — edit several fields at once)

```json
{
  "displayName": "TechSolutions",
  "phone": "+237698765432",
  "timezone": "Africa/Douala",
  "preferred_language": "fr",
  "avatarFileId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439040",
  "payout_details": [
    {
      "method": "mobile_money",
      "mobile_money": {
        "provider": "MTN Mobile Money",
        "phone_number": "+237670000000",
        "account_name": "Tech Solutions Sarl"
      },
      "bank": null
    }
  ],
  "notificationPreferences": { "email": true, "whatsapp": false, "phone": false },
  "version": 3
}
```

> **Business name/description/logo/banner are not editable here** — they live on the [Store](./store.md) (`PATCH /api/vendor/store`).

#### Field Reference

All fields are **optional except `version`**. Every field below maps to a profile/onboarding concept; send only what changed.

| Field | Type | Validation | Onboarding step it maps to | Notes |
|-------|------|------------|----------------------------|-------|
| `displayName` | `string` | 2–100 chars | — (general) | The vendor's **personal/display** name. The **business** name is on the [Store](./store.md), not here. |
| `email` | `string` | Valid email, lowercased ([Contact formats](../README.md#contact-formats-phone--email)) | — (general) | **Feature-gated** — rejected with `403` when `ALLOW_EMAIL_CHANGE=false`. |
| `phone` | `string` | **E.164**, e.g. `+237670000000` ([Contact formats](../README.md#contact-formats-phone--email)) | — (general) | Contact phone. |
| `country` | `string` | Exactly 2 chars, ISO-2 (auto-uppercased) | Step 1 (Basic Setup) | **SET-ONCE / IMMUTABLE.** Chosen during onboarding Step 1 and locked afterwards — sending a *different* value is rejected with `403 PROFILE_COUNTRY_IMMUTABLE`. Echoing the current value back is accepted (idempotent no-op). It anchors the business-address policy below. |
| `timezone` | `string` | Min 1 char, IANA tz | Step 1 (Basic Setup) | E.g. `"Africa/Douala"`. Freely editable — this (plus `preferred_language`) is the profile's localization surface. |
| `preferred_language` | `string` | One of `en`, `fr`, `pt`, `es`, `ar` | — (general) | The vendor's language, stored on this profile and used for **all notifications** (in-app, email, WhatsApp templates). There is no separate "notification language" — this is it. Defaults to `en`. |
| `avatarFileId` | `string \| null` | MongoDB ObjectId of a file uploaded via `POST /api/files/upload`, or `null` | — (general) | The vendor's **personal profile avatar** (distinct from the business logo/banner, which live on the [Store](./store.md)). A **file reference**: registers the file as *in use* (`entityType: "vendor", field: "avatar"`) and blocks its deletion until detached. *Clearable*: `null` or `""` detaches it. Read back as the populated `avatar` file object. |
| `payout_details` | `object[]` | 1–3 entries, ordered (index 0 = preferred). **`method` must be `"mobile_money"` today** — `"bank"` and `"card"` are 🚧 switched off | Step 1 (Basic Setup) | Full replace. Sub-schema is identical to onboarding — see [Step 1 field reference](./onboarding.md#step-1-basic-setup-required), or **[Payout methods](./payout-methods.md)** for the full reference. Entries stored before the switch still read back and are still paid; you just cannot re-send one. |
| `business_addresses` | `object[]` | See onboarding sub-schema | Step 3 (Branding) | Full replace — **include each existing address's `_id`** (from the `GET` response) to preserve its identity, or a fresh id is generated (and the "old" one is treated as removed — see below). These are the vendor's **physical store locations and pickup points**, so every **new or edited** entry must carry a `geo` (selected `/api/geo/search` result; see [Geospatial addresses](../geo/README.md)) that resolves **inside the profile's `country`** — otherwise `400 ADDRESS_GEO_REQUIRED` / `400 ADDRESS_COUNTRY_MISMATCH` / `400 ADDRESS_REGION_INVALID` (2026-10-02: the region must name one of the country's regions — see [onboarding Step 3](./onboarding.md#step-3-branding-optional--skippable)). Entries echoed back byte-identical (same loose fields, same `geo`) are grandfathered, so legacy plain-text addresses keep working until next touched. Because it is a full replace, echo `geo` back on unchanged entries or it counts as an edit. See [Step 3 field reference](./onboarding.md#step-3-branding-optional--skippable). |
| `operating_hours` | `object[]` | Per-day `{ day, open_time "HH:MM", close_time "HH:MM", is_closed }` | — (general) | Full replace. |
| `policies` | `object \| null` | `{ return_policy?, cancellation_policy?, support_policy?, documents? }` (sub-policies nullable) | Step 4 (Policy Setup) | Full replace of the **whole** `policies` object — include every sub-policy you want to keep. `documents` (max 2 URLs) is cleared if omitted. See [Step 4 field reference](./onboarding.md#step-4-policy-setup-optional--skippable). |
| `kyc_details` | `object` | `{ national_id_number }` | — (general) | `legit_verified` is **admin-only** and ignored if sent. |
| `social_links` | `object` | `instagram`, `facebook`, `twitter` — valid URLs or `null` | — (general) | Full replace. |
| `notificationPreferences` | `object` | `{ email?, whatsapp?, phone? }` booleans | — (general) | **Only `phone` is gated** — `phone: true` is refused with `403 AUTH_FORBIDDEN` (`vendor-profile.service.ts:297-302`). `email` and `whatsapp` are both accepted. See below. |
| `version` | `number` (integer) | **Required**, must match current profile `version` | — | Optimistic-locking guard. Mismatch → `409`. |

> **Not editable here:** `default_delivery_agency_id` (onboarding Step 2). Use the dedicated delivery-agency routes below. `legit_verified`, `status`, and `onboarding_step` are server/admin-controlled.

> **Clearable fields**: every nullable string above (`avatarFileId`,
> `social_links.*`, `kyc_details.national_id_number`, address
> `address_line2`/`state`, policy `return_condition_notes`/`eligibility_notes`/`availability_description`)
> accepts `null` **or `""`** to clear — both are stored and returned as `null`. Omit a key to leave it
> unchanged. See [Conventions](../README.md#conventions).

  }
}
```

#### Notes

- **Editing onboarding fields**: After onboarding completes, this endpoint is the **only** way to change values originally captured in the onboarding flow (payout, branding, policies, timezone). The onboarding step endpoints are locked (`409`). Exceptions: **`country` is immutable after onboarding** (`403 PROFILE_COUNTRY_IMMUTABLE`), and the default delivery agency has its own dedicated routes.
- **Localization lives here, not on the store.** `timezone` and `preferred_language` are profile fields; `preferred_language` drives the language of every notification (there is no separate notification-language setting). The store has no language, address, or country of its own — see [Store Profile](./store.md).
- **Full-replace semantics**: `payout_details`, `business_addresses`, `operating_hours`, `social_links`, and `policies` overwrite the stored value wholesale. Always send the complete desired value, not a delta. For `business_addresses` specifically, echo back each entry's `_id` to preserve its identity — see the note above and [Update Product](./products.md#update-product) for why this matters to pickup locations.
- **Removing an in-use business address is blocked, not applied.** If the array you send omits (or regenerates the id of) an address that's still set as one or more physical products' `delivery.pickupLocation`, the **entire** `business_addresses` update is rejected with `409 VENDOR_BUSINESS_ADDRESS_IN_USE` — nothing is partially saved. `error.details.blockedAddresses` lists each such address with how many products reference it:
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "requestId": "3f8a1c74-9b2e-4d10-8c55-6a0f2b7e19dd",
    "error": {
      "code": "VENDOR_BUSINESS_ADDRESS_IN_USE",
      "message": "One or more business addresses you removed are still set as a pickup location on a product. Reassign or remove that pickup location first.",
      "statusCode": 409,
      "category": "conflict",
      "details": {
        "blockedAddresses": [
          { "addressId": "683abc1234567890abcdef02", "label": "Main Shop", "productCount": 3 }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  Reassign or clear those products' `delivery.pickupLocation` first (`PATCH /api/vendor/products/:id` — see [Update Product](./products.md#update-product)), then retry the address removal.
- **Optimistic Locking**: The `version` field prevents concurrent update conflicts. Always include the current version number from the GET response.
- **Email Changes**: If `ALLOW_EMAIL_CHANGE=false`, email updates are rejected. Contact support to change email.
- **Notification Preferences**: `email` and `whatsapp` are both settable; only `phone` is refused (`403 AUTH_FORBIDDEN`, `vendor-profile.service.ts:297-302`) because no SMS provider is integrated. WhatsApp sends are metered against the credit wallet at send time rather than gated here.

### PATCH /api/vendor/profile/password

> [!WARNING]
> **Deprecated alias.** Password change is now a shared endpoint: **`PATCH /api/me/password`** — same body, same responses. See [me/password.md](../me/password.md). This vendor path routes to the same handler (`UserController.updatePassword`) and is kept only so existing frontends don't break.
>
> ⚠ **The two are NOT fully equivalent, and this warning claimed they were until 2026-09-06.**
> The handler is shared; the **guards are not**. `/api/me/password` is mounted on a router with
> `requireAuth` and **no role guard** — its own comment reads *"Shared across all roles — no
> `requireRole` guard"* (`users/user.routes.ts:11-15`). This alias sits under the vendor
> router's blanket `router.use(requireRole(['vendor']))` (`vendor/routes.ts:22`), so it
> **additionally** requires the vendor role. A signed-in agency, agent or customer gets
> `403 AUTH_ROLE_NOT_FOUND` here and succeeds on the shared path. "Works for every role" is
> true of `/api/me/password` only.

Change the authenticated vendor's password.

#### Authentication

- **Required**: Yes
- **Role**: `vendor`

#### Headers

```http
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "oldPassword": "CurrentPassword123!",
  "newPassword": "NewSecureP@ssw0rd"
}
```

**Fields**:

- `oldPassword` (**required**, string): Current password
- `newPassword` (**required**, string): New password

**Password Requirements**:
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character

#### Response

**Success (200 OK)**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Password updated successfully. All other sessions have been signed out."
}
```

Also sets fresh `access_token` and `refresh_token` cookies — see the session note below.

}
```

#### Notes

- **Password Verification**: The old password must be correct before the new password is set.
- **Session Invalidation**: **Implemented.** Every session issued under the old password ends
  — any access or refresh token minted before the change is refused with
  `401 AUTH_PASSWORD_CHANGED`. The caller's own pair is replaced via `Set-Cookie` on this
  response, so this session survives and no other one does. Full description in
  [me/password.md](../me/password.md).

### GET /api/vendor/profile/default-delivery-agency

Retrieve the authenticated vendor's currently-configured default delivery agency details.

> [!NOTE]
> This may return a non-null agency **even if you never called the `PUT` endpoint below** —
> the vendor's first-ever approved [agency connection](./agency-connections.md) is automatically
> set as their default. Onboarding Step 2 (`PUT /api/vendor/onboarding/delivery-linking`) no
> longer sets this directly; see [Onboarding](./onboarding.md#step-2-delivery-linking-optional--skippable).

#### Authentication

- **Required**: Yes
- **Role**: `vendor`

#### Headers

```http
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

#### Response

**Success (200 OK)**:
Returns the agency details as a vendor-safe `VendorAgencyListItemDto`. Returns `null` if no default is configured.

### PUT /api/vendor/profile/default-delivery-agency

Set or update the authenticated vendor's default delivery agency outside the onboarding flow. Not
needed for your very first agency — see the auto-assignment note below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **You don't need to call this for your first agency.** The vendor's first-ever approved
> [connection](./agency-connections.md) is set as the default automatically, no call needed. Use
> this endpoint to *switch* between multiple active contracts afterward.
>
> **Vendors can change their default agency but can never clear it to null.** There is no `DELETE` route. A vendor's default only becomes unset if the underlying agency itself is deactivated by an admin — see [Admin: Delivery Agencies](../admin/delivery-agencies.md).
>
> **Switching to an active agency restores suspended products.** If the vendor's physical products were suspended because their previous default agency was deactivated, switching to a different **active** agency here immediately restores every one of those products to its own saved prior status (draft → draft, active → active, etc.). Switching to a `pending_verification` agency is accepted as a valid choice but does **not** restore anything yet, since a pending agency doesn't satisfy the physical-product activation gate.
>
> **Also auto-reassigns in-flight orders.** Any of the vendor's order items that are still `pending`/`assigned` (not yet picked up) and were riding on the *old* default agency are automatically moved to the new one — same effect as calling the item-level reassignment endpoint for each. An item is skipped (left on the old agency) if its **product** has its own explicit delivery-agency override, since that item was never really "on the default" in the first place. Items already `picked_up` or later are never touched. See `meta.reassignedOrderItems` / `meta.skippedOrderItems` in the response below.
>
> **Requires an active, approved connection with the agency.** You can no longer set any active agency as your default — only one you've sent (or received and accepted) a connection request with, and which is currently `active` (not pending, rejected, or paused for reapproval). Browse agencies and send/manage requests via [Agency Connections](./agency-connections.md). Attempting to set an agency without an active connection returns `422 CONNECTION_NOT_ACTIVE`.

## Order Automation Settings

Per-vendor automation toggles stored on the vendor settings document. Created lazily
on first read/write, so defaults apply until a vendor changes them.

### GET /api/vendor/profile/auto-redirect-orders

Returns whether paid physical orders auto-dispatch to the agency in charge, plus the
optional max-order-total cap.

#### Authentication

- **Required**: Yes
- **Role**: `vendor`

#### Response

**Success (200 OK)**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "autoRedirectOrdersToAgency": false,
    "autoRedirectThresholdAmount": null
  }
}
```

- `autoRedirectOrdersToAgency` *(boolean)* — when `true`, a paid physical order's
  shipments advance `pending → assigned` automatically. Default `false`.
- `autoRedirectThresholdAmount` *(number | null)* — max order `total_amount` (in the
  order's own currency) for which auto-redirect applies. Orders above this cap stay
  `pending` for manual dispatch even when the toggle is on. `null` (default) = no cap.

### PUT /api/vendor/profile/auto-redirect-orders

Enable/disable auto-dispatch and optionally set the cap.

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "thresholdAmount": 50000
}
```

- `enabled` *(boolean, required)*.
- `thresholdAmount` *(number ≥ 0 | null, optional)* — omit to leave the existing cap
  unchanged; send `null` to clear it (no cap); send a number to set the cap.

#### Response

**Success (200 OK)**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "autoRedirectOrdersToAgency": true,
    "autoRedirectThresholdAmount": 50000
  },
  "message": "Auto-redirect orders setting updated"
}
```

### GET /api/vendor/profile/auto-cancel-unpaid-days

Returns the number of days an order may remain unpaid before a daily background sweep
auto-cancels it (sets `fulfillment_status='cancelled'`, `payment_status='failed'`, and
notifies via the `order.cancelled` event).

#### Response

**Success (200 OK)**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { "autoCancelUnpaidDays": 3 }
}
```

- `autoCancelUnpaidDays` *(number)* — default `3`.

### PUT /api/vendor/profile/auto-cancel-unpaid-days

Set the unpaid-order auto-cancel window.

#### Request Body

```json
{ "days": 5 }
```

- `days` *(integer, required)* — minimum `1` (cannot be `0`), maximum `90`.

#### Response

**Success (200 OK)**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { "autoCancelUnpaidDays": 5 },
  "message": "Auto-cancel unpaid orders setting updated"
}
```

## Feature Flags & Configuration

### Email Change Lock

**Environment Variable**: `ALLOW_EMAIL_CHANGE`

- `true`: Vendors can update their email address
- `false` (default): Email changes are disabled, returns error with support contact message

**Use Cases**:
- Prevent spam/abuse
- Maintain email verification integrity
- Enforce business rules

### Notification Channels

**WhatsApp Notifications**:
- **Status**: **Available on every plan.** `whatsapp: true` is accepted by `PATCH /api/vendor/profile`.
- **How it is limited**: not by a flag — by **credits**. Each outbound template message is metered against the credit wallet at send time (see [Billing overview](./billing-overview.md)).

**Phone Notifications**:
- **Status**: Refused — `403 AUTH_FORBIDDEN` on `phone: true` (`vendor-profile.service.ts:297-302`).
- **Why**: no SMS provider is integrated yet. `VendorConfig.ENABLE_PHONE_NOTIFICATIONS` is hardcoded `false` (`vendor.config.ts:34`).

**Email Notifications**:
- **Status**: Always available
- **Default**: Enabled

> ⚠ **This block listed WhatsApp as "Feature-flagged OFF (hardcoded)" until 2026-09-06.** The
> flag it referred to — `VendorConfig.ENABLE_WHATSAPP_NOTIFICATIONS` (`vendor.config.ts:26`) —
> is **read by no code at all**; the service's gate tests `phone` alone. A vendor dashboard
> that hid or disabled the WhatsApp toggle on the strength of this section was hiding a
> working control.

## Optimistic Locking

All profile updates use **optimistic locking** to prevent data loss from concurrent modifications.

### How It Works

1. Client fetches profile: `GET /api/vendor/profile` → receives `version: 3`
2. Client modifies fields locally
3. Client sends update: `PATCH /api/vendor/profile` with `version: 3`
4. Server checks if current version is still `3`
   - **Match**: Update succeeds, version incremented to `4`
   - **Mismatch**: Returns 409 Conflict error
5. On conflict, client refreshes profile and retries

### Best Practices

- Always include the `version` field in update requests
- Handle 409 Conflict errors by refreshing data and prompting user to retry
- Display clear message: "Profile was updated elsewhere. Please refresh and try again."

---

## Domain Events & Audit Logging

### Events Emitted

**Profile Updated**:
```javascript
eventBus.publish('vendor.profile.updated', {
  eventType: 'vendor.profile.updated',
  aggregateId: vendorId,
  payload: {
    vendorId,
    changes: { email: { from: 'old@example.com', to: 'new@example.com' } }
  },
  occurredAt: new Date()
});
```

**Password Changed**:
```javascript
eventBus.publish('user.password.changed', {
  eventType: 'user.password.changed',
  aggregateId: userId,
  payload: { userId, role: 'vendor', roleEntityId: vendorId },
  occurredAt: new Date()
});
```

### Audit Logs

All profile updates and password changes are logged for compliance:

```javascript
auditLogger.log({
  actor: { userId, role: 'vendor' },
  action: 'VENDOR_PROFILE_UPDATED',
  resource: { type: 'Vendor', id: vendorId },
  changes: { displayName: { from: 'OldName', to: 'NewName' } },
  timestamp: new Date()
});
```

## Future Enhancements

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

The system is designed for future 2FA integration:

- `twoFactorEnabled` field exists in response
- When implemented, sensitive operations (password change, email change) will require 2FA verification
- Extension point ready in service layer

### Pricing Plans

> ⚠ **This section sketched plan-gating WhatsApp behind
> `VendorConfig.ENABLE_WHATSAPP_NOTIFICATIONS`. That is not the direction the platform took**,
> and the snippet was removed on 2026-09-06 because it read as a description of current
> behaviour. WhatsApp shipped **available on every plan and metered by credits** at send time
> (`vendor-profile.service.ts:293-295`); the constant it named is dead
> (`vendor.config.ts:26`, referenced nowhere in `src/`). Billing shapes WhatsApp through the
> credit wallet and the plan's caps — see [Billing overview](./billing-overview.md) — not
> through this flag.

`phone` is the only channel still behind a flag (`VendorConfig.ENABLE_PHONE_NOTIFICATIONS`,
hardcoded `false`), and it is waiting on an SMS provider rather than on a pricing tier.

### Session Management

A password change invalidates every session issued under the old password. There is **no**
session store, and deliberately so: tokens here are stateless JWTs, so the revocation is a
per-account instant (`password_changed_at`) written in the same update as the new hash, and
both credential paths — every authenticated request and every refresh — refuse a token whose
`iat` predates it with `401 AUTH_PASSWORD_CHANGED`.

- No Redis key per vendor, no session list to delete, nothing to keep in step with the token.
- Revocation is account-wide, not vendor-wide: the password lives on the **User**, so every
  role the account holds is signed out together.
- The caller performing the change receives a replacement cookie pair on the response and
  keeps working.

## Error Codes Reference

| Code | HTTP Status | Category | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 400 | `validation` | Request body failed validation. `details.fields[]` names each one |
| `AUTH_MISSING_TOKEN` · `AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID` · `AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED` | 401 | `authentication` | Missing, malformed or expired token |
| `AUTH_ROLE_NOT_FOUND` | 403 | `authorization` | The caller is not a vendor |
| `AUTH_FORBIDDEN` | 403 | `authorization` | A vendor, but refused — email changes locked, or a plan-gated notification channel (`vendor-profile.service.ts:288,301`) |
| `USER_INVALID_PASSWORD` | 403 | `authorization` | The current password supplied to the password change is wrong (`users/user.service.ts:70`) |
| `ADDRESS_GEO_REQUIRED` | 400 | `validation` | A **new or edited** `business_addresses[]` entry carried no `geo` (`address-country.helper.ts:57-64`, reached from `vendor-profile.service.ts:315`). `details` names the offending `{ index, label }` |
| `ADDRESS_REGION_INVALID` | 400 | `validation` | 2026-10-02. A new/edited business address names no region of its country, by region or by city. `details: { index, label, region, city, countryCode, allowedRegions: [{ key, name }] }` — show a picker, resend with `geo.components.region` = the picked `key` |
| `ADDRESS_COUNTRY_MISMATCH` | 400 | `validation` | A new/edited address geocodes outside the profile's `country` (`address-country.helper.ts:69-82`) — or, when `country` is being set for the first time on a legacy profile, an **existing** address already sits outside it (`vendor-profile.service.ts:246-252`). The two raise the same code with different `details` |
| `AUTH_USER_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | `not_found` | No vendor profile for this account (`vendor-profile.service.ts:260`) |
| `PROFILE_COUNTRY_IMMUTABLE` | 403 | `authorization` | `country` is set once at onboarding Step 1; a *different* value is refused, an echo of the current one is accepted (`vendor-profile.service.ts:226-231`) |
| `VENDOR_BUSINESS_ADDRESS_IN_USE` | 409 | `conflict` | The `business_addresses` array you sent drops an address still set as a product's `delivery.pickupLocation`. **Nothing is partially saved.** `details.blockedAddresses[]` lists each with its `productCount` (`vendor-profile.service.ts:176-181`) |
| `VENDOR_FISCAL_CALENDAR_INVALID` | 409 | `conflict` | **Optimistic-locking version mismatch.** ⚠ The code is misnamed on the wire and says nothing about a fiscal calendar (`vendor-profile.service.ts:334`) — **branch on `statusCode === 409 && category === 'conflict'`**, not on this string, which may be corrected in a future wire change |
| `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` | 500 | `internal` | Unexpected server error. The message is replaced with the registry default and `details` is dropped, in every environment |

**Additionally, on the two default-delivery-agency routes only** (`GET`/`PUT /api/vendor/profile/default-delivery-agency`, and the pickup-location read beside them):

| Code | HTTP Status | Category | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DELIVERY_AGENCY_NOT_FOUND` | 404 · **also 400** | `not_found` · `validation` | 404 when the `agencyId` matches no agency (`vendor-profile.service.ts:762`, `:828`). ⚠ **The same code is also raised at 400** for an agency that exists but is `inactive` or has not finished onboarding (`:831`, `:834`) — so branch on `statusCode`, not on the code alone |
| `CONNECTION_NOT_ACTIVE` | 422 | `business_rule` | You have no `active` connection with that agency. Send or check a connection request first (`vendor-profile.service.ts:767-771`, `:838-843`) |

> ⚠ **This table named six codes and FIVE OF THEM DID NOT EXIST** until 2026-09-06 —
> `UNAUTHORIZED`, `FORBIDDEN`, `NOT_FOUND`, `CONFLICT` and `INTERNAL_ERROR` are in no registry.
> A client branching on any of them never matched, and fell through to its generic handler. Every
> row above was read from the source line it cites. Re-check rather than trusting the table:

## Security Best Practices

1. **Always use HTTPS** in production
2. **Store JWT tokens securely** (httpOnly cookies or secure storage)
3. **Never log sensitive data** (passwords, tokens)
4. **Implement rate limiting** on password change endpoint
5. **Monitor for suspicious patterns** (rapid email changes, failed password attempts)
6. **Rotate JWT secrets** periodically
7. **Implement session timeout** for inactive users

## Example Workflows

### Update Display Name

```bash
# 1. Get current profile
curl -X GET https://api.example.com/api/vendor/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Response: { "data": { "version": 5, ... } }

# 2. Update display name
curl -X PATCH https://api.example.com/api/vendor/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "displayName": "My New Business Name",
    "version": 5
  }'
```

### Change Password

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.example.com/api/vendor/profile/password \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "oldPassword": "OldSecureP@ss123",
    "newPassword": "NewSecureP@ss456!"
  }'
```

### Enable Email Notifications

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.example.com/api/vendor/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "notificationPreferences": 
    {
      "email": true
    },
    "version": 5
  }'
```

### Change Payout Details (post-onboarding, from Settings)

Onboarding is already complete, so `PUT /onboarding/basic-setup` would return `409`. Edit via the profile endpoint instead. Send the **complete** payout array (full replace):

> 🚧 Only `mobile_money` can be configured right now — `bank` and `card` are switched off. See
> [Payout methods](./payout-methods.md#availability).

```bash
# 1. Read current version
curl -X GET https://api.example.com/api/vendor/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
# Response: { "data": { "version": 7, ... } }

# 2. Replace payout details
curl -X PATCH https://api.example.com/api/vendor/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "payout_details": [
      {
        "method": "mobile_money",
        "mobile_money": {
          "provider": "MTN Mobile Money",
          "phone_number": "+237670000000",
          "account_name": "Tech Solutions Sarl"
        },
        "bank": null
      }
    ],
    "version": 7
  }'
```

### Add a card as your payout destination — 🚧 switched off

> **Not available right now.** `bank` and `card` are switched off at the write path; only
> `mobile_money` can be configured today, and sending anything else returns `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`
> on `payout_details[n].method`. See
> [Payout methods](./payout-methods.md#availability). The recipe below
> is kept for when the switch flips back.

Same endpoint, same full-replace rule — `"method": "card"` with a `card` sub-object. Here the card
is made the **preferred** destination (index 0) and an existing mobile-money entry is kept as the
fallback:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.example.com/api/vendor/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "payout_details": [
      {
        "method": "card",
        "card": {
          "brand": "visa",
          "last4": "4242",
          "card_holder_name": "JEAN DUPONT",
          "expiry_month": 8,
          "expiry_year": 2029,
          "country": "CM",
          "issuing_bank": "Afriland First Bank"
        }
      },
      {
        "method": "mobile_money",
        "mobile_money": {
          "provider": "MTN Mobile Money",
          "phone_number": "+237670000000",
          "account_name": "Tech Solutions Sarl"
        }
      }
    ],
    "version": 8
  }'
```

> **Never send the card number or CVV.** There is no field for them and the request is **rejected**
> if you include one (`400 VALIDATION_ERROR` naming the offending key) — deliberately, so a `200`
> can never be mistaken for "the number is stored". Read
> **[Payout methods → card](./payout-methods.md#card)** before you build the form; it covers the
> refused field names, the optional `gateway_token`, and how a card payout is settled today.
